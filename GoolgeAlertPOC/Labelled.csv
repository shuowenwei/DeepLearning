China, France and India are among the nations defending globalization against a wave of protectionist sentiment led by U.S. President Donald Trump. Beijing is reinforcing its commitment to open markets, reform and global growth, but it?s not happy about new U.S. tariffs imposed this week.

CGTN?s Nathan King reports.



From France?s President Emmanuel Macron to India?s Narendra Modi, leader after leader at the World Economic Forum defended globalization, calling for more, not less.

Chinese President Xi Jinping?s speech at Davos last year has been called a turning point. It was a robust defense of globalization that China continues to uphold in 2018.

Liu He, director of the General Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, said that, ?After decades of development, a large-scale middle income population has emerged in China, giving rise to a vast domestic market. We believe that this open domestic market, with fast growing middle-income population of 400 million, will contribute significantly to global development. The Belt and Road Initiative originated from China, but it is the idea that will deliver opportunity and benefits to the whole world.?

As the U.S. President arrived at Davos, anticipation for his keynote speech Friday is growing, with many there wondering if the world?s largest economy will find itself isolated on global economic policy.

On the eve of the trip, White House officials stressed that the policy of ?America First? will benefit everyone.

?We?re going to the World Economic Forum to share President Trump?s economic story and to tell the world that America is open for business,? said White House Economic Advisor Gary Cohn.

?We want the world to invest in America and to create jobs for hard-working Americans. President Trump?s economic agenda has unleashed the U.S. economy, and we are growing,? he said.

While a booming U.S. economy is good for the world, many world leaders say trade barriers are not. And with new U.S. actions expected soon on steel and aluminum, the world is wary that the U.S. is putting up trade barriers while the rest of the world moves to pull them down.

Chinese Ministry of Commerce Spokesman Gao Feng said, ?I would like to reiterate that cooperation is the only correct choice for both China and the U.S. China?s door of cooperation and dialogue is always open. We hope that the China-U.S. trade frictions won?t get escalated, and the two sides can resolve their conflicts and facilitate pragmatic cooperation through a constructive way.?

?Meanwhile, China will take all appropriate measures to firmly protect its own legitimate rights and interests, while coping with those unilateral and protectionism actions that don?t follow WTO?s rules.?

As the U.S. raises tariffs, Pacific and Asian nations are lowering them. Eleven nations are set to sign a renamed Trans-Pacific partnership next month.

It could have been 12. Up until last year, the U.S. led those negotiations, but President Trump pulled out of the agreement in his first few weeks in office.",Dan McClory is an RR that I am doing heightened surveillance on in conjunction with the heightened surveillance on his firm Boustead Securities.

Best practices for managing  your 401(k) and IRA,https://lasvegassun.com/native/city-national-bank/2018/may/17/best-practices-for-managing-your-401k-and-ira/,https://lasvegassun.com,Yes,Fraud,"Best practices for managing your 401(k) and IRA

Thursday, May 17, 2018 | 10 a.m.

According to a 2016 report from the Economic Policy Institute, almost half the families in the United States do not have a retirement savings account. Many of today?s retirees are living off defined benefit plans, such as Social Security or pensions, but an increasing number of future retirees will depend on defined contribution plans?401(k)s and IRAs.


?401(k)s are fairly general, but there are a number of pitfalls and mistakes that people make with them,? said Paul Couch, Vice President and Senior Finance Advisor at City National Securities.

Learning how to take full advantage of your plan and optimize your benefits now can help ensure a healthy balance come retirement age.

Common types of retirement plans

Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs and 401(k)s are common examples of defined contribution plans, which are tax-favored retirement accounts. The funds in these accounts vary based on the amount of money contributed and the earning-performance of the investment. These plans tend to assume more risk than defined benefit plans, which guarantee a certain amount based on a fixed formula.

In 2016, the Pew Charitable Trusts reported that 51.6 percent of employees had access to defined contribution plans, whereas only 12.2 percent had access to defined benefit plans. While 401(k)s and IRAs were not intended to be the dominant method of retirement planning, they can certainly fill that gap when managed responsibly.

? 401(k): The most common employer-sponsored retirement plan, a 401(k) allows participants to contribute pre-tax income which is typically matched by the employer (up to a certain percentage). Taxes are only paid once the money is withdrawn during retirement.

Contribution limit for 2018: $18,500

Income limit: None

? IRA: Unlike 401(k)s, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are usually not employer-sponsored and can be created by the individual. Traditional IRA accounts take pre-tax contributions, and participants don?t pay taxes until the money is withdrawn during retirement.

Contribution limit: Generally $5,500. For participants 50 and older, up to $6,500

Income limit: None

? Roth IRA: Roth IRAs differ from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s because Roth accounts require post-tax contributions, but the withdrawals during retirement are tax-free?even on earnings.

Contribution limit: Generally $5,500. For participants 50 and older, up to $6,500

Income limit: Less than $135,000 (for singles) or $199,000 (if married and filing jointly)

Roth 401(k) options

?Many 401(k)s offer a Roth option, allowing participants to use after-tax dollars on a tax-deferred basis,? Couch said. Roth 401(k)s are especially beneficial for younger employees, so if your company offers a Roth option, take it.

Pro tip: ?A Backdoor Roth is a great option for people whose salary exceeds the income limit for Roth IRAs. This approach lets you open a traditional IRA, which has no income limit, and then immediately convert it into a Roth IRA. You want to make this conversion immediately after your contribution,? Couch said.

Tips for optimizing your 401(k)

1. Know what you?re contributing: Evaluate your contribution levels, your company?s match and the overall contribution limit.

?You may not be capitalizing on all the benefits you could be,? Couch warned. Review your contributions each year and make changes when necessary.

2. Take advantage of your company?s match: Most companies match 3-6 percent of the employee?s gross salary, so make sure you?re taking advantage of it.

If your employer matches up to 6 percent, you should be contributing at least 6 percent as well. ?If you?re not meeting your company?s match, you?re leaving free money on the table,? Couch said.

3. Contribute as much as you can: ?Many people accept the default contribution percentage, but don?t settle for that if you can do more,? Couch said. Treat your company?s match as your minimum contribution and strive to hit the maximum contribution if possible.

Keep in mind, the $18,500 contribution limit for 401(k)s only refers to your contribution?whatever the company matches will be compounded on top of that.

4. Don?t use it until retirement: One of the most detrimental things anyone can do with their retirement plan, besides simply not having one, is tapping into the funds early.

?Don?t be forced into an early distribution or take loans out against the plan if you can avoid doing so. Make sure you have other savings available for emergencies?your 401(k) should only be your absolute last resort,? Couch said.

There?s typically a 10 percent penalty for withdrawing prior to retirement, in addition to the income taxes due at the time of withdrawal.

Maintaining your 401(k) during job transitions

Companies that match 401(k) contributions do so under specific terms. Oftentimes, there?s a minimum amount of time you need to be employed by the company in order to receive their match.

?When you take a new job, know how long the vesting schedule is in their 401(k) to ensure you?re getting the full match amount,? Couch said. Further, when you leave a company, Couch recommends taking your employer-sponsored 401(k) and rolling it into a personal IRA.

A common mistake people make when leaving a company is taking the 401(k) distribution themselves?and getting stuck with a 20 percent tax penalty. Putting it into an IRA in your own name avoids this problem.",The article quotes an RR from my firm.

Broker and His Firm Charged on Improper UIT Trades,http://financialadvisoriq.com/c/2061513/236593,http://financialadvisoriq.com,Yes,Fraud,"Broker and His Firm Charged on Improper UIT Trades
By Alex Padalka August 16, 2018
Massachusetts? top securities cop has charged a Los Angeles broker and his firm with improper trading in unit investment trusts, InvestmentNews writes.

StockCross Financial Services and Peter Cunningham allegedly recommended that clients buy and sell the UITs before they matured, which allegedly resulted in more commissions for the firm and the broker while causing losses for clients, the Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin?s office said, according to the publication. The regulator also charged StockCross with failing to supervise Cunningham, InvestmentNews writes.

Cunningham and Beverly Hills, Calif.-based StockCross allegedly earned $750,000 in commissions from short-term trading in UITs just from their Massachusetts clients, which make up 30% of the firm?s customers, Galvin said, according to the publication. At the same time, Cunningham was allegedly so far in debt that his wages were being garnished and he had been served with at least two home foreclosure notices, according to a statement from Galvin?s office cited by InvestmentNews. The regulator is seeking a cease-and-desist order, censure, restitution to clients and an administrative fine, according to the publication. In addition, Galvin?s office is seeking to revoke Cunningham?s right to practice and to force StockFirst to bring an independent consultant to assess its supervisory procedures, InvestmentNews writes.

Cunningham first registered with Finra in 1994 and joined StockCross in 2002, according to his BrokerCheck profile.

He?s currently listed as registered at StockCross and at Muriel Siebert & Co., which is also based in Beverly Hills, according to BrokerCheck.

Gaming Platform Jump World Plans New York IPO of Up to $50 Million
A Shanghai company, Jump World Holdings Ltd., is looking to raise between $25 million and $50 million in an initial public offering on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol ""JMPW.""

Targeting China's youth, Jump World aims to become ""one of the most popular technology-enabled entertainment communities,"" as it develops and operates games on computer, mobile, virtual reality, augmented reality, and console devices.

image.png

The games on Jump Worlds' platforms are supplied with ""high-quality, rich and dynamic"" content, the company said in its prospectus filed Wednesday, as well as real-time interactive features and include multiplayer, first-person, fighting, and casual games.

The company, which generates revenue from selling ""virtual diamonds,"" which in its games can be exchanged for virtual perks, reported its revenue of $29.4 million last year, a $3 million increase from 2016. Net income in 2017 reached $6.5 million, up 33 percent year-over-year.

For the six months through June, Jump World said revenue was $16.9 million, up 8 percent from a year ago. Net income increased 13 percent year-over-year to $5.2 million. The company had $9.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30.

The growth of the company comes as it taps into one of the fastest-growing segments in China. The country is today the world's largest gaming market for online and digital games, and the market continues to expand, with game revenue expected to reach $39 billion by the end of this year, up from $32.5 billion in 2017. Citing Venture Beat News research in its filing, Jump World said the number of gamers in China is expected to increase to 768 million by 2022.

(Source: Jump World's prospectus filed Sep. 5)

In addition, the company said, the amount of time Chinese youth spends on gaming cumulatively rose from 260 million hours per day in 2016 to 416 million hours this year, representing a roughly 22 percent increase. Gaming now accounts for 13 percent of people's daily time spent across all mobile entertainment segments, coming in behind social network and video.

However, Jump World's filing comes at a time when Beijing has focused its attention on the increasing problem of myopia among Chinese youth. Last week, China's gaming giant, Tencent Holdings Ltd. (HKEX: 0700), lost about $20 billion in market value after China intensified a crackdown on online gaming citing rising levels of myopia, heightening regulatory risks for companies.

China's Ministry of Education, in a notice last Thursday, directed the publishing regulator to limit the number of new online video games, take steps to restrict the time young people spent playing games, and explore an age-appropriate system for players.

Jump World has a strategic partnership with Alibaba Cloud, a cloud service provider of China's giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: BABA). The gaming company's tech platform operates through 200 physical servers leased from Alibaba Cloud and uses its cloud computing, data storage, and bandwidth services.

The proceeds of the stock offering on Nasdaq would be used for general corporate purposes, including investment in product research and development, sales and marketing, technology, capital expenditures, and corporate purposes, Jump World said.

The firm aims to sell its stock at $12.50 per share while the precise number of shares to be sold has not been determined, according to its filing.

The underwriter on the deal, Boustead Securities LLC, has the right to increase Jump World's IPO total to $57.5 million for over-subscription.",Provides information about the underwriting activities of the firm.

Ed Cofrancesco of International Assets Advisory explains why he believes some advisors should get a second chance.

Ed Cofrancesco is a man that believes in second chances.

Cofrancesco started in the industry when he was 16 years old and still in high school. He is now president and CEO of International Assets Advisory.
International Assets Advisory is an independent broker-dealer and RIA that has been serving financial advisors and institutions since 1982. The current owners, including Cofrancesco, acquired the firm nearly 12 years ago. The firm has an international focus, which includes investing internationally for U.S. investors as well as investing in the U.S. for non-U.S. investors.

Ed Cofrancesco Ed Cofrancesco
?I?m a stupid street kid from Brooklyn. I didn?t finish college ? [and now] I have more money than I ever thought I was going to have in my life,? he told ThinkAdvisor.

The way Cofrancesco sees it, his whole career has shaped who he is.
?One of the things I believe in is giving people second chances,? he said.

By this, he means he?s not afraid to bring into the firm advisors or brokers that might have regulatory or disciplinary actions on their record.

?We have hired our fair share of advisors who have had issues,? he said.

International Assets Advisory, which is a midsize firm, has about 160 advisors. Of that, Cofrancesco says 35% to 40% might have something on their record.

?Some of them maintain 100% of their innocence to this day, and based on circumstances I?ve seen in some cases I had every reason to believe that they were telling the truth and believe in that now,? Cofrancesco explained. ?Others were small technicalities that got blown into big issues with their firm. Others may have done something wrong at the time and didn?t realize they were doing something wrong.?

Then there are the others that have flat-out lied and made it sound like they were innocent when they were not, Cofrancesco said.

?We?re really good at sorting that out through our review process when we hire them,? Cofrancesco added. ?And even then, I?d say maybe one out of 10 slips through, but within a year or so we can determine [they lied] ? and bye-bye.?

A 2017 study by Reuters with the assistance of Columbia University Law School identified nearly 48% of the 140 total brokers at the time at International Assets Advisory as having flags from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The FINRA flags that the study examined included regulatory sanctions, customer complaints that resulted in a payment, criminal cases that resulted in a plea agreement or conviction, and bankruptcies.

?We?ve gotten some bad press over the years,? Cofrancesco admitted. ?If you look at raw numbers versus other firms, we?re always in the top 20 in terms of firms percentage-wise that have people with marks on their license. But then you have to look at the marks my advisors have. It?s a quantitative analysis but not a qualitative analysis.?

While the firm may rank high in regards to brokers with a regulatory history, Cofrancesco is quick to point out the firm has had a low number of FINRA actions in its 36-year history ? and zero in the time that Cofrancesco has been in charge.

International Assets Advisory has seven disclosures, and the most recent one one was almost 18 years ago.

?So, you compare our regulatory history to our peers, I?ve been quoted in the past as saying ?exemplary? ? because it is,? Cofrancesco said. ?I don?t have time for nonsense. But, I also believe in second chances.?

Cofrancesco gave ThinkAdvisor an example of one advisor he gave a second chance.

?This guy worked for a very well-known national firm ? [and] his firm required that when you do a financial plan, the client sign off on the request of the financial plan,? he told ThinkAdvisor. ?That was just the rule of the firm.?

In one instance, he was doing a financial plan for a client and the sales associate working with him was supposed to get the client to sign the document.

?[The sales associate] realized she hadn?t gotten them to sign,? Cofrancesco said. ?She calls the client ? they had just left the office ? [and] asks them to come back. And they say, ?Can?t you just sign it for me???

And she did ? unbeknownst to this advisor, Cofrancesco said.

Several months later, it came out in an internal audit. This advisor explained he didn?t know anything about it, the sales associate confessed, and the auditor gave the firm a slap on the wrist, according to Cofrancesco.

Several months after that, the advisor left for another firm. His old firm opened an investigation.

FINRA eventually offered the advisor a $5,000 fine and 30-day suspension. The new firm then fired him, saying he didn?t disclose that he had an ongoing investigation.

?When this guy called me up when he got cut from his firm ? someone told him to call Ed ? [he was] crying,? Cofrancesco said. ?Thought his life was over. How was he ever going to make a living again??

To Cofrancesco, though, this was one of his best ? and most trustworthy ? hires.

?If I was to get hit by a train tomorrow, I?ve told my wife, he?s the guy you should put our money with to take care of you the rest of your life,? he said. ?That?s how trustworthy this guy is!?","Although the information in the article was known to Surveillance staff, brocasting to publc was of added risk/concern.

Sept. 11, 2018 3:54 p.m. ET
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has issued its first disciplinary action involving cryptocurrencies.

Finra, a self-regulatory organization, on Tuesday filed a complaint against Timothy Tilton Ayre, saying he committed securities fraud and unlawfully distributed HempCoin, an unregistered, cannabis-focused cryptocurrency security.

The complaint comes after scrutiny from regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, in addition to well publicized scams and a broad selloff in the cryptocurrency market.

Finra alleges in the complaint that between January 2013 and October 2016, Mr. Ayre, of Agawam, Mass., ?attempted to lure public investment in his worthless public company,? Rocky Mountain Ayre Inc.

Mr. Ayre couldn?t immediately be reached for comment.

The broker allegedly issued and sold HempCoin, which he publicized as ?the first minable coin backed by marketable securities,? and allegedly made fraudulent statements about Rocky Mountain Ayre?s business and finances, according to the complaint. The company was quoted on the Pink Market of OTC Markets Group and was traded over the counter.

Mr. Ayre allegedly bought the rights to HempCoin and repackaged it in June 2015 as a security backed by stock in Rocky Mountain Ayre, according to the complaint. The broker allegedly marketed HempCoin as equivalent to 0.10 shares of the publicly traded company, Finra said.

Through late 2017, investors mined more than 81 million HempCoins and bought and sold the securities on two cryptocurrency exchanges, the complaint said. Mr. Ayre didn?t register HempCoin, Finra said.

Under Finra rules, a firm or individual named in a complaint can file a response and request a hearing before a Finra disciplinary panel. Possible actions include a fine, censure, suspension or bar from the securities industry, disgorgement of gains associated with the violations and payment of restitution.",Involves Crytocurrency and Fraud

Pashinyan-Putin meeting to paper over differences between two countries
YEREVAN, September 7. /ARKA/. The meeting of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, scheduled for September 8 in the Kremlin, will paper over a string of differences that have arisen in the bilateral relations, Ruben Safrastyan, the director of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Armenian National Academy of Sciences, said today.

""Russian-Armenian relations are facing serious challenges, and today decisive steps are needed to preserve their high level,"" Safrastyan told journalists. According to him, critical stories in Russian media about developments in Armenia, as well as statements by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the latest steps of the Armenian government, indicate that Russia?s top leaders get the wrong idea about the ongoing processes in Armenia.

""We hope that the upcoming meeting will once again confirm that Armenia's foreign policy of developing close allied relations with Russia has not changed.  We believe that the Armenian side will be able to convey this to Russian leadership,"" Safrastyan said.

According to Safrastyan, Russian top leadership should not worry about Armenia?s periodic rapprochement with NATO or the West, as there is no alternative for the Armenian people to the military-strategic partnership with Russia.

""For Armenia there is no alternative to the military cooperation with Russia, including within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty Organization. History has shown that our expectations from Western partners can not guarantee our security. We have strong Armenian communities in the United States and other Western countries, however, when it comes to military cooperation and real security guarantees, they can not replace Russia,"" he said. 

According to Safrastyan, cooperation with NATO and other Western international structures develops  in the areas of regional security, economy, human rights and others. 

On July 31 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia was worried that the situation in Armenia was still boiling. Earlier top Russian officials made it clear that Moscow was concerned over the new Armenian government?s latest move, including prosecution of former president Robert Kocharyan and a former deputy defense minister Yuri Khachaturov, the current secretary general of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization. -0-","Search term is ""Western International"", but search found hit of international news, not firm."

With tears in her eyes, Glacier County EMS Director Amie Allison said, ?Quitting my job is the hardest thing I?ll ever do.? 

Allison resigned on Tuesday, Aug. 7, stating, ?I feel I need to sacrifice my position at Glacier County EMS for the benefit of the department staff ?? She also stated Glacier County Commissioner Ron Rides At The Door ?has also been able to identify that you do have an agenda against me?? Allison hopes her resignation ?will promote positive change for the department and provide an opportunity for a working team as I requested.?

Allison said her resignation was effective immediately. 

(A complete copy of her letter of resignation appears on page 4.)

With her resignation letter, Allison provided the Glacier County Commissioners with a very detailed 12-page outline of the work she has done recently lobbying various state and federal agencies to increase reimbursement for services provided by all state EMS agencies, not just Glacier County. 

The outline also includes the many steps taken by Allison and her department to reduce expenses and decrease debt.

Allison pointed out to the commissioners they must still deal with the deficit created when Clerk and Recorder Glenda Hall failed to apply for a low interest $800,000 building loan, which is half the amount of the $1.6 million deficit from the new EMS building. 

When it comes to the future of the EMS service, she told the commissioners, ?I cannot stress including the community enough.?

Northern Rockies Medical Center CEO Cherie Taylor attended the Aug. 7 meeting to not only express support for Allison and the Glacier County EMS but also to follow-up on the mill levy dollars that were to be paid out in June but still have not been received from the county. According to Taylor, NRMC is owed approximately $300,000 in total.

Hall told Taylor she would ?pay out? the amount currently in the fund on Thursday, Aug. 9, which is about $184,000. The balance due is from protested and delinquent taxes, which cannot be disbursed yet, she added.

Taylor then spoke in support of the Glacier County EMS Service and informed the commissioners and Hall that NRMC is not in a financial position to assume the ambulance service. ?The EMS is really important to the residents of Glacier County,? she stated. ?We most definitely don?t want to see that service lost.? If the service is reduced to responding only to 911 calls, and not doing transports, it will be ?very devastating.? 

Chairman Michael DesRosier repeatedly referred to the debt created by the Glacier County EMS and stated, ?Right now I don?t think we can keep 100 percent of the services? adding he wasn?t sure of the level of service they can afford to provide, stating the EMS budget ?keeps getting further and further in debt...?

Allison presented new contract reimbursement figures from the Indian Health Service for the commissioners to approve, which will help the EMS revenue stream. She attempted to explain many times the statewide issue with Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements and legislative changes that are needed to assist EMS agencies throughout the state.

DesRosier pointed out ?the money situation here in Glacier County?we just don?t have any money?we should have caught this a lot earlier. We should?ve been more aware.?

Taylor asked when the commissioners were going to make their decision on the EMS and the services it provides. DesRosier said the commissioners are ?going over the books? with hired consultant Robert Denning, who is still working on the FY 2018 year-end close-out.

DesRosier said the county is looking at applying for loans and some applications have gone out to banks.

The commissioners are also looking into the process for putting on the ballot a mill levy to fund the EMS. The deadline for such an action is sometime later this month said Hall, who was looking up the laws during the meeting.

DesRosier said these are just some of the ideas the commissioners are looking into to ?hang on to the service.?

According to the approved April 2018 cash report, Glacier County funds were in the red by some -$3.6 million. The commissioners were asked where the money is coming from to meet the ongoing payroll and claims.

?I don?t know exactly,? said DesRosier, ?but we are paying the bills.?","Firm's name is M.E. Allison, google matches for for me, Allison. So all noise. "

If the MaxPreps state rankings hold true, the near future looks bright for East English Village Prep. On Friday they take on Western International at 4:00 PM. Both teams will be looking for a pick-me-up after considerable defeats in their previous games.

East English Village Prep took a serious blow against River Rouge last Thursday, falling 0-60.

Meanwhile, Western International might be aching after a bruising 0-30 defeat to Cody.

With both teams hitting sour notes in their previous games, they will no doubt be looking to produce a better outcome in this one. Hopefully the teams can find a way to make up for their last outings by putting some points on the board this time.

0?? SHARES
Last month, American Airlines announced it was dropping 11 international routes, including a Shanghai-Chicago direct flight. This comes on the heels of American?s Beijing-Chicago route cancellation in May and a report that Hawaiian Airlines? would drop its direct flight between Honolulu and Beijing.

Rising fuel prices are undoubtedly the biggest culprit behind these rollbacks. In May 2017, the price for a gallon of jet fuel stood at $1.41. A year later, the price had risen by 52 percent to $2.15. But many airlines and analysts also contend that unfair Chinese policies are undercutting international carriers and making their transpacific routes unprofitable.

Fuel prices are the primary driver of the recent route cuts at American, but Chinese airlines offering cheaper prices on many routes is a contributing factor that?s hard to ignore

Accusations of unfair government aid going to China?s airlines have circulated for years, and the country?s three biggest carriers?China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Air China?are all state-owned. However, it?s clear last month?s route rollbacks at American were primarily driven by fuel costs.

By some estimates, fuel costs account for between 17 to 22 percent of airlines? operating costs, and many expected cutbacks due to the steady rise in fuel costs. Long-haul routes are the logical initial cutback since they are more expensive per capita in terms of fuel. Moreover, the 11 routes American cut in August include routes like Philadelphia-Munich, New York (JFK)-Dublin-Edinburgh, and Los Angeles-Toronto. It?s not simply a China affair.

Still, it?s hard to deny that Chinese airlines, with the help of government aid, have a distinct edge when it comes to maintaining profitability on international routes by offering dramatically lower ticket prices. Part of this advantage is due to the lower-quality services on Chinese flights (compared to the standards on Western international carriers), but that disparity isn?t as dramatic as it was in the past.

Instead, the fault lies with Chinese governments?both at national and municipal levels?who have collaborated to make sure that Chinese cities have robust international connections, and the primary beneficiaries of these efforts are Chinese airlines. Subsidies make up the biggest share of this aid, although tying down exact figures is challenging.

Late last year, a report revealed that Chinese airlines received a total of $1.3 billion (RMB 8.6 billion) in state subsidies from municipal governments, with large metropolises like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou taking the largest shares. These airlines used this money to subsidize the costs of operating direct flights to long-haul destinations in the U.S. and Europe, and the sum accounts for almost the entire profit margin for the top four Chinese airlines.

In 2016, total subsidies for Chinese airlines grew to an estimated $1.3 billion

However, it isn?t just major urban centers that China aggressively seeks to connect to international locales. Smaller cities around China are also offering similar subsidies, spurring an explosion in the number of applications for new international routes by Chinese carriers. For example, the city of Qingdao offered $11,690 (RMB 80,000) per 200-seat flight to nearby Asian destinations. These subsidy agreements likely have little to no impact on the bottom lines of American or other international carries, but they do illustrate how smaller Chinese airlines can afford such quick expansions.

Chinese airline subsidies are particularly frustrating for destinations with their own carriers that have open-sky agreements with China, as the country is effectively giving government-subsidized Chinese flights access to destinations where they compete against unsubsidized carriers. Though it?s hard to calculate just how big a profitability advantage this gives Chinese airlines, even a seemingly minor advantage of a few percentage points could be enough to push other carriers off routes going in and out of China.

Chinese aviation authorities have opted to restrict expansion for international carriers and have also allegedly limited or denied their access to coveted times slots at Chinese airports

Of course, it?s not simply subsidies that are benefiting Chinese airlines at the cost of competitors. At the national level, the Chinese government has restricted international carriers? access to many Chinese destinations. The Chinese government fined Emirates $4237 (RMB 29,000) last year for two ?safety infractions? that both occurred in airspace over Xinjiang Province. The airline was also blocked from adding new destinations or aircraft to China for six months. The fine itself was not particularly punishing to the airline, but the restriction on expansion was undoubtedly damaging to the Dubai-based carrier in the China market.

International carriers have also complained that Chinese authorities give them consistently bad takeoff and landing times, making their flights more unattractive to travelers. American Airlines formally filed a complaint to the U.S. Department of Transportation against the renewal of an Air China route between Beijing and Houston, citing unfair treatment by Chinese aviation authorities.

So, while rising fuel costs have done plenty to help shut down long flights from international carriers, in China, strong government patronage of hometown airlines is certainly a factor as well.","Search term is ""Western International"", but search found hit of airline article, not firm."

MassMutual wants to open a 17-story, $240 million office building at the Seaport?s Fan Pier in 2021.
By Tim Logan GLOBE STAFF  JUNE 19, 2018
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. is set Wednesday to receive major tax breaks for a planned expansion in Springfield and Boston.

A state board will vote on an anticipated $46 million in tax credits over five years for the insurance giant, which is moving 1,500 jobs to its headquarters in Springfield, and planning to add 800 jobs at a new building in Boston?s Seaport District.

It?s one of the largest such tax packages ever awarded in Massachusetts, and the biggest given to a company in the western part of the state, according to the Baker administration. Many of the company?s new jobs in Springfield are simply being relocated several miles north from an office MassMutual plans to shutter in Enfield, Conn. Others will come from other MassMutual offices in North Carolina, New Jersey, and Tennessee. The company also plans to invest about $50 million in its headquarters campus in Springfield.

The Seaport expansion will be MassMutual?s first significant foray into Boston, where it aims to tap into the city?s tech and financial services workforce. MassMutual wants to build a 17-story, $240 million office building at Fan Pier, the Fallon Co. development in the Seaport, in which MassMutual is a major investor. That building is currently under review by the Boston Planning & Development Agency. MassMutual hopes to open it in 2021.

Under terms of the tax credit agreement, which will be finalized at a Worcester meeting of the state?s Economic Assistance Coordinating Council, MassMutual must add 2,000 jobs in the state over the next several years if it is to receive the full $46 million.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - Ningjia Huang of Fujian, China, was just starting to get excited about studying computer science in the U.S. when a Las Vegas gunman opened fire at a country music concert, killing 58 and wounding more than 500, last Oct.1

Lucas Long Pham, a data science student from Hanoi, Vietnam, had just been accepted at Case Western Reserve University when a Florida man gunned down 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14.

Although stunned and frightened, and despite the fact that such shootings never occur in their home countries, both students still came to Cleveland to start classes at Case Western. Each is the first in their families to study in the U.S.

For the second straight year, the number of new international students coming to study at U.S. colleges and universities is expected to decline from the 300,743 who came in 2015-16, according to the Institute of International Education.

""This year will be the first time that we begin to see a clear slowdown in the number of international students coming to the U.S.,"" said Rajika Bandari, senior research advisor for IIE and an expert on international students and academic mobility.

Of 522 higher education institutions surveyed last year, 52 percent of the schools said prospective students cited ""the current U.S. social and political climate as a potential deterrent to U.S. study.""


Just under half reported a drop in new international student numbers, and 20 percent said international students ""expressed the desire to leave or have left"" the U.S. as a result of the current climate.

That's a source of concern, because those 1.1 million international students ""contribute significantly to the research and entrepreneurial leadership of the United States, supporting over 450,000 U.S. jobs, and adding over $39.4 billion to the U.S. economy in 2016,"" according to U.S. Department of Commerce data cited by IIE.

At Kent State University, ""our numbers have declined quite substantially,"" said Marcello Fantoni, associate provost for global education. The school is expecting about 400 fewer international students than last fall, for a total of about 1,730.

Although 600 to 700 international students are graduating this year, the number of new international students is only 250 to 300. ""Not only is American not being perceived as a welcoming destination, it's also the reduction in the number of visas issued for students,"" he said.

""It is very enlightening when I travel, to see America through the eyes of the people we speak to, and hear their questions about America: 'Is it safe to study in America?' 'Will I have problems with my student visa?'""


And as America's international reputation falters, countries like Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Korea, New Zealand and the Netherlands have begun more aggressively recruiting international students. ""International enrollment in Canada has skyrocketed in the past two years,"" he said.

Kent, one of the top U.S. universities for Saudi Arabian students, is trying to better understand why the Saudi government has shrunk a program that gave full scholarships and stipends to Saudi students accepted by U.S. colleges. ""Students had successful experiences at Kent, and they would trust us with their students,"" he said.

Other Ohio colleges and universities seem to have largely defied what's happening nationally. Some of the schools with the largest number of international students say they expect an increase in the number of foreign students this year, although final numbers aren't confirmed for the 2018-19 school year.

Rounak Chawla, a first-year student from Kolkata, India, chose to study at Case Western because its 50,000-square-foot Sears Thinkbox is the largest university innovation space in the world. But he said friends warned him that ""it's harder to get a job in the U.S. now, and you might have trouble with immigration.""

Chawla said some of his high school classmates opted to attend college in France, Spain, and the Netherlands. Even without President Trump's well-known views on immigrants, ""if international students don't feel safe coming to the United States, they will not come,"" he said. 

Ohio ranks No. 8 in the nation for the number of foreign students, hosting 38,680 international students in 2017, up 2.5 percent from the previous year's 37,752.

Those 38,680 foreign students collectively spent an estimated $1.18 billion in the state, up from $1.1 billion in 2016, according to IIE.

The five Ohio schools with the largest number of foreign students in fall 2017 were: Ohio State University, with 7,684; University of Cincinnati, with 4,013; Kent State University, with 3,625; Miami University in Oxford, with 2,654; and Case Western Reserve University, with 2,565.

At Ohio State's main campus in Columbus, ""We have 1,120 international new first-year students who have paid an acceptance fee, compared to 712 at the same point last year,"" said university spokesman Benjamin Johnson. 

The University of Cincinnati has issued 1,218 visa documents to incoming, new international students for this fall, compared to just under 1,164 issued last fall. ""Our projected number of incoming international students looks to be on par with or slightly higher than last year,"" said M.B. Reilly, director of public relations.


At Case Western Reserve University, international undergraduate applications were up by about 25 percent, and fall enrollment is expected to be similar to the last few years, said Rick Bischoff, vice president for enrollment in undergraduate admissions. 

""While we're not seeing it in terms of the numbers, those of us who travel internationally and meet with students face to face are hearing questions like 'Is the U.S. safe for me?' 'Am I welcome in the United States?' Questions we didn't get a few years ago,"" Bischoff said.

""There's more anxiety on the part of students in terms of getting visas and all of that, concerns that something might go wrong in the process. When I'm traveling abroad and I see the different perceptions of the U.S., it can be jarring.""'

Case has gone out of its way to attract international students, attending college fairs in Europe and Asia, and working with the International Association of College Admission Counseling ""to showcase Cleveland and the kind of place that Cleveland is,"" Bischoff said.

""Six or seven years ago, there was only one [college admissions] person who traveled around the world. Now we have half a dozen, and we go to a lot more countries and meet a lot more students.""


They talk up Case's diversity and tell prospective applicants that unlike at most schools, ""we have international students who are getting up to full financial aid packages to be here,"" he said.

As a result, 21 percent of the incoming class are citizens of other countries or have dual citizenship, and they come from 56 countries.

The social issues, public policy changes and political disagreements in the U.S. are only some of the factors discouraging first-time students, Bandari of IIE said. For example, Saudi Arabia and Brazil each scaled back scholarship programs that had brought large numbers of students to the U.S. in recent years.

Even so, ""international students overwhelmingly want to be in the U.S., and the demand and the desire to gain a U.S. credential is still very strong,"" she added.


From left, Rounak Chawla, 18, of India; Lucas Long Pham, 17, of Vietnam; and Ningjia Huang, 18, of China, all arrived in Cleveland last month to study at Case Western Reserve University. All new to Ohio, each came to the U.S. despite news of gun violence, strict immigration enforcement, and political disagreements. For the second straight year, the number of new international students coming to study at U.S. colleges and universities is expected to decline. But at Case Western Reserve University, international undergraduate applications were up by about 25 percent.","Google Searched firm name ""Western International"", but the search did not generate hits of the firm."

Host of Peace FM?s flagship programme ?Kokrokoo?, Kwami Sefa Kayi has called on religious leaders in the country to let their voices be heard on the matter of government?s decision to establish a National Cathedral in the heart of capital, Accra.

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo on March 6, 2018 unveiled an architectural design for the construction of a National Cathedral.

The Cathedral is aimed at fostering national cohesion and creating an avenue for national prayers and religious events to be held as part of the Akufo-Addo?s heritage to the country.

There are however several controversies over the site for the Cathedral with government intending to demolish some buildings and properties to have the project at Ridge in Accra.

The National Cathedral is to sit around a 14-acre garden and will have chapels, a baptistery, a music school, an art gallery, a Bible Museum and Documentation Centre - It is expected to seat 5,000 people in its main auditorium.

According to Mr. Sefa Kayi, the Cathedral though a laudable initiative by the government, he has serious issues over its intended location.

He questioned why the government is not thinking about spreading its tentacles by constructing the Cathedral in another ideal place other than the capital.



?The idea of having a National Cathedral is a laudable one but most importantly, we should reconsider its location. Have we thought about the traffic situation in the capital??

He wondered why religious leaders like the General Overseer of the International Central Gospel Church, Dr Mensah Otabil and Archbishop Duncan Williams of the Action Chapel International, among others seem to have gone silent over the issue.

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo, in March 2017, inaugurated a 13-member Board of Trustees who will be in charge of the National Cathedral when it is completed.



The Board, largely constituted by heads of various church groups, have also been tasked to oversee the successful completion of the national chapel.

The board members include; Most Reverend Asante Antwi as the Chairman, Archbishop Charles Plamer Buckle as Vice Chairman and Prophet Kusi Boateng, who is the Secretary to the Board.

The rest are, Apostle Opoku Onyinah, Rev. Joyce Aryee, Moderator, Presbyterian Church, Cephas Amenyo, Right. Rev. Offei Akrofi, Archbishop Nicholas Duncan Williams, Rev. Eastwood Anaba, Bishop Dag Heward-Mills, Pastor Mensa Otabil, Rev Dr. Frimpong Manso and former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, Professor. Emmanuel Martey.



The ace broadcaster urged these renowned men of God to speak up on the issue and be loud about it and not allow government communicators to hold brief for them.

?(Pastor) Mensah Otabil, (Archbishop) Duncan Williams, Bishop Asante Antwi and other leaders on the Committee; why aren?t they talking?

Woodward's book 'Fear' puts readers 'face to face with Trump'
WASHINGTON (CNN) - President Donald Trump's chief of staff John Kelly should resign and testify before Congress about his time in the White House, legendary investigative journalist Carl Bernstein said.

Bernstein, now a CNN political analyst, defended his former colleague Bob Woodward's explosive new book ""Fear: Trump in the White House"" on CNN's ""New Day"" Wednesday morning, which includes reporting that Kelly called Trump an ""idiot"" and ""unhinged.""

""(The book) is a reconstruction of meeting after meeting after meeting in which you begin to wonder why doesn't John Kelly, the chief of staff, go to the Congress of the United States in executive session, resign for the good of the country, go to the Congress and say 'I want to answer all of your questions about this president in full about what the context is, about what's in this book, et cetera, et cetera,' and then let's see how it holds up,"" Bernstein said.

ADVERTISING
 
Having read the book, Bernstein said it includes scenes ""described in great detail"" that show how ""principals, not disgruntled former employees"" view their job in the White House as ""protecting the country from the President of the United States.""

According to Woodward's reporting, Kelly is quoted in the book as saying of Trump at a staff meeting in his office: ""He's an idiot. It's pointless to try to convince him of anything. He's gone off the rails. We're in crazytown. I don't even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I've ever had.""

In a statement Tuesday, Kelly denied that he referred to Trump as an ""idiot.""

""He always knows where I stand, and he and I both know this story is total BS,"" Kelly said.


Bernstein and Woodward were both Washington Post reporters who helped uncover the 1970s Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon. Bernstein vouched for his former colleague's methodology of reporting of drawing from hundreds of hours of interviews with first-hand sources and documents to back up quotes, saying it was the same method the pair used while reporting on the Nixon administration.

""This doesn't come from one source,"" he added.

Trump and the White House have pushed back on the allegations in Woodward's book, but Woodward stands by his reporting.","Search term is ""Cetera"" and hit came from article's word ""et cetera""."

Chinese digital advertising agency Hylink has opened a subsidiary business that aims to cater for brands targeting outbound tourists.


Digital agency Hylink expands to travel subsidiary
Hylink Travel will aim to offer travel brands and destination marketing organisations the ability to target consumers through its digital offering. This subsidiary will offer travel brands and tourism organisations access to social media, influencer engagement, media buying, SEO, analytics and other services.

Headquartered in Santa Monica, the company has been retained by Brand USA, San Francisco Travel Association, and Hawaiian Airlines to execute digital campaigns across various platforms, it revealed.

?Not only do we see tremendous market opportunity in the Chinese outbound travel space, but there is an important element of intercultural connection and understanding,? said Su Tong, chief executive and founder of Hylink. ?Travel is an essential component of becoming a global citizen, and we feel fortunate to be able to facilitate this among Chinese travelers.?

Humphrey Ho, managing director of Hylink USA, has been tasked with spearheading the expansion of Hylink?s travel offer.

?Our goal is to provide best-in-class digital advertising services to travel industry clients and to serve as their strategic advisors; ultimately leaving them better informed on the Chinese consumer behaviors, media, and technology that is essential for success within what is a highly complex market,? explained Ho.","This was generated from Alerts for my firm ""Digital Offering,"" which is a very common term.  99.99% of the articles I receive are like this one.

Jess Moskaluke, Madeline Merlo, Shania Twain, and Kira Isabella kick things off at the CCMA?s at First Ontario Centre Sunday night. - Barry Gray,The Hamilton Spectator

Shania Twain, Keith Urban and the Canadian Country Music Awards have now left the building. But don't fret, country fans, they're coming back.

Well, maybe not Shania and Keith, but definitely the awards show.

Before Sunday night's nationally televised extravaganza had even started, Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger and Canadian Country Music Association president Tracy Martin let it slip that the awards would return to FirstOntario Centre in September 2020.

""The CCMAs are coming back to Hamilton in 2020,"" Martin told more than 950 members of the music industry gathered at the Hamilton Convention Centre Saturday night for the CCMA gala annual dinner.

Canadian Country Music Awards returning to Hamilton in 2020
That's a good thing for Hamilton, especially if the 2020 show is anything like the one awards show held Sunday night at FirstOntario Centre. Tourism Hamilton estimates it drew 10,000 visitors to the city over the past five days.

The show opened with CCMA nominees Jess Moskaluke, Kira Isabella and Madeline Merlo teaming up for a spectacular medley of Shania hits, with the star herself joining them for ""Honey I'm Home.""

Shania then took over the stage as host of a show that would turn into a love fest for the Timmins-born star.

""Man it feels so good to be home and even better to be coming to you live from Hamilton,"" said Shania, noting that she won her first CCMA award 23 years ago in Hamilton. ""This is a country town. It's got the heart, it's got the grit and, judging from that opening, it's definitely got the fans.""

Two hours later, the show closed with Paul Brandt joining Moskaluke, High Valley and the Hunter Brothers for a rousing rendition of Johnny Cash's classic ""I Walk the Line.""

In between, a few awards were handed out ? Moskaluke took album of the year honours, while Dallas Smith won male artist of the year and Meghan Patrick won female artist of the year (she almost took a header trying to climb over a velvet rope barrier trying to get to the stage but recovered gracefully). The Washboard Union took home two awards for group of the year and roots act of the year.

Just to make sure the CBC TV audience knew the show was being broadcast from Hamilton, they added a few sure fire hints ? such as having Tiger-Cats receiver Luke Tasker present the single of the year award to the James Barker Band for ""Chills"" (it was also the top selling country single in the country). The Ticat defence got equal time, with linebacker Simoni Lawrence presenting the Sirius XM Rising Star Award to Cambridge brother-sister duo The Reklaws.


The show also featured an unbelievably cute Kira Le, a young student from Hamilton's James MacDonald Elementary School, explaining how a $10,000 grant from the industry-funded Musiccounts program helped her school buy ukuleles.

""Playing music makes me feel better and focus on my other classes,"" Le said.

There was another nice Hamilton touch ? the unveiling of a new countrified video version of Parachute Club's ""Rise Up,"" the iconic empowerment anthem recorded 35 years ago at Hamilton's Grant Avenue Studio.

The video features the voices of Gord Bamford, Patrick, Tim Hicks, Tebey, Isabella, Kissel, Jason McCoy and The Washboard Union and is now available for download on iTunes. Proceeds from its sale will go to selected charities involved with youth as selected by Lorraine Segato, the Hamilton-born lead singer of Parachute Club.

Australian country rocker Keith Urban added some international star power to the show by performing his current hit ""Never Coming Down."" Urban returned to the stage a few minutes later to induct Terri Clark into the Canadian Country Hall of Fame.

Patrick, Suzy Bogguss and Jessica Mitchell joined Clark for a medley of her hits. Clark called the experience ""truly humbling and surreal."" There was another standing ovation. Clark later returned to the stage to sing a duet with Dallas Smith, ""One Drink Ago.""

Shania, as host, was everywhere ? mingling with fans for ""a big Hamilton hello"" and rubbing shoulders with 11-year-old American yodelling sensation Mason Ramsey.

She also took home a few of her own awards ? the fan choice award, as well as bestselling album of the year and bestselling Canadian album of the year.

Shania was even presented with a special CCMA Generation award by Grammy winning pop star Alessia Cara. The award, handed out to stars who introduce country music to non-country fans, has only been given out once before, to Taylor Swift.

""I faced a lot of harsh criticisms for bringing a different style to the county world, but fans and audiences embraced my music,"" Shania told the crowd. ""My audience and fans are why I'm still here and loving what I do.""

Shania, of course, got another standing ovation.","Search term is ""Hamilton Grant"", but only ""Hamilton"" appears in article. Article is not about the firm."

Broker and His Firm Charged on Improper UIT Trades,http://financialadvisoriq.com/c/2061513/236593,http://financialadvisoriq.com,Yes,operational,"Broker and His Firm Charged on Improper UIT Trades
By Alex Padalka August 16, 2018
Massachusetts? top securities cop has charged a Los Angeles broker and his firm with improper trading in unit investment trusts, InvestmentNews writes.

StockCross Financial Services and Peter Cunningham allegedly recommended that clients buy and sell the UITs before they matured, which allegedly resulted in more commissions for the firm and the broker while causing losses for clients, the Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin?s office said, according to the publication. The regulator also charged StockCross with failing to supervise Cunningham, InvestmentNews writes.

Cunningham and Beverly Hills, Calif.-based StockCross allegedly earned $750,000 in commissions from short-term trading in UITs just from their Massachusetts clients, which make up 30% of the firm?s customers, Galvin said, according to the publication. At the same time, Cunningham was allegedly so far in debt that his wages were being garnished and he had been served with at least two home foreclosure notices, according to a statement from Galvin?s office cited by InvestmentNews. The regulator is seeking a cease-and-desist order, censure, restitution to clients and an administrative fine, according to the publication. In addition, Galvin?s office is seeking to revoke Cunningham?s right to practice and to force StockFirst to bring an independent consultant to assess its supervisory procedures, InvestmentNews writes.

Cunningham first registered with Finra in 1994 and joined StockCross in 2002, according to his BrokerCheck profile.

He?s currently listed as registered at StockCross and at Muriel Siebert & Co., which is also based in Beverly Hills, according to BrokerCheck. He has 11 customer disputes on his record, dating back to 2000, and an employment separation from 2001, when TD Waterhouse Investor Services discharged Cunningham following ?multiple customer complaints,? according to his profile.",State of MA has charged the firm and a broker with improper trading in UITs

"7th Lawsuit Filed Against Cetera Advisors, LLC and Broker George Craig Merhoff Jr. by Soreide Law Group",http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3922942,http://www.digitaljournal.com/,Yes,Operational,"7th Lawsuit Filed Against Cetera Advisors, LLC and Broker George Craig Merhoff Jr. by Soreide Law Group

 
Sep. 4, 2018 / PRZen / KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. -- GEORGE MERHOFF (CRD# 2918171) is employed as a registered representative of CETERA ADVISORS in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Recently the State of Oregon, Department of Consumer and Business Services Division of Financial Regulation, has entered a cease and desist order against Respondents CETERA ADVISORS, LLC, and GEORGE MERHOFF. The Department found that two (unnamed) customers of Respondents were sold large concentrated positions in energy in their managed accounts to customers who did not understand the risks associated with them.

Respondents were ordered to pay a $70,000 fine and a suspended fine of $35,000 if they could prove that MERHOFF is being adequately supervised. The findings already made by the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation mirror a similar pattern of misconduct in the latest lawsuit filed by attorney Lars Soreide, Esq., of Soreide Law Group on behalf of his Klamath Falls clients.

In the seven lawsuits filed by Soreide Law Group, it was alleged that many of the customers of Merhoff were completely reliant on his advice and had managed accounts. It is alleged that, MERHOFF, for some clients, made large concentrated positions in oil and gas related investments. MERHOFF concentrated many of his customer's accounts in high-risk oil and gas investments, including but not limited to: Linn Energy, PenGrowth Energy Corp, Seadrill Partners, Energplus, Cliffs Natural Resources, Teekay Partners, and Vale S.A.

MERHOFF has racked up twenty four (24) reported customer complaints on his U4. The significance of MERHOFF'S customer complaints is underscored in FINRA NOTICE to MEMBERS 03-49. In 2003, FINRA conducted a review of the CRD's of all 663,000 registered representatives, only 2,751 (.41%) had been the subject of (3) or more customer complaints. In other words MERHOFF's customer complaints rank him in the top one-hundredth percent of all registered representatives for customer complaints.  The vast majority of the reported conduct all relates to similar conduct at issue here involving material misrepresentations and negligent recommendations involving deceptive trade practice allegations.

The Klamath Falls clients of Soreide Law Group allege that there was no hedging or stop loss strategy implemented in the accounts. Most of these losses were to irreplaceable retirement savings.  Over-concentrated positions in risky oil and gas investments are totally unsuitable for a conservative portfolio. Many investors represented by Soreide Law Group were looking to invest instable income producing investments and not speculate with their irreplaceable life savings.

If you were former or current client of George Merhoff and suffered losses due to his actions or recommendations, call Soreide Law Group, at  888-760-6552 or visit https://www.securitieslawyer.com.

An important part of tZERO?s strategy is to buy, build or partner in order to aggregate all necessary components to have end-to-end ownership of its trading, clearing and settlement platform.  The investment in StockCross adds a key partner with the custodial and clearing functionality of a U.S. DTCC member firm to tZERO?s trading ecosystem.

?We view our acquisition of 24 percent of StockCross, and our relationship with the Gebbia family, as another key step toward achieving our goal of being the first fully regulated security token trading platform,? said Joseph Cammarata, president of tZERO. ?This collaboration unlocks enormous potential and provides us with enterprise-level economies of scale for both of our companies.?

Today?s announcement begins the strategic relationship between tZERO and StockCross. Under the terms of the transaction, tZERO has acquired a 24 percent interest in StockCross for $12 million.

In connection with this transaction, tZERO will receive approximately 1.2 million shares of Siebert.

?Our vision is to bring the benefits of blockchain capital markets to the world without imposing large switching costs on participants in the current US National Market System. To achieve that, we are inch-by-inch stitching together a blockchain capital market which we intend to integrate into the current U.S. National Market System. This investment in StockCross, a FINRA member firm and a DTCC member firm, is a large step in that direction,? said Patrick M. Byrne, CEO of tZERO and Overstock.com.

In a separate transaction, tZERO purchased a 1 percent ownership interest in Kennedy Cabot Acquisition, LLC, the controlling owner of Siebert. As a result of tZERO?s ownership in Kennedy Cabot Acquisition, LLC, tZERO will own beneficially approximately an additional 200,000 shares of Siebert. tZERO?s beneficial ownership of Siebert shares will total approximately 1.4 million shares or 5.3 percent of Siebert?s outstanding shares.

This week Jane Street Capital a global proprietary trading firm has announced it has been trading BTC these days. Often referred to as one of Wall Street?s most secretive investment companies, Jane Street says if cryptocurrencies continue to rise they expect to be involved.

The ?Secretive? and High-Tech Trading Firm Jane Street is Flipping Bitcoins
This High-Tech Wall Street Trading Firm is Now Trading BitcoinThe trading firm Jane Street is operated in New York City, London and Hong Kong. The company actively trades $8-13 billion worth of equities, Bonds, Futures, Options, and other investments. Jane Street claims to execute over 1Mn trades per day. The New York Times has referred to Jane Street as one of the most secretive firms out there that handles a lot of trade volume. The news outlet called the traders ?coders with a Ph.D.? and the firm specializes in lots of arbitrage trades. According to Business Insider, the firm has explained it is now dabbling in BTC trading.

Arbitrage opportunities in the world of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin are very tempting to firms like Jane Street because spreads can be very high on different trading platforms. Global BTC exchanges can have as much as 10 percent in arbitrage opportunities between each trading venue. Jane Street has not given any details on how it has been trading BTC but explains that if cryptos continue to be hot, the company will continue to remain active.

?Jane Street trades over 56,000 products globally across a wide variety of asset classes, including bitcoin,? the company explains this week.  

Jane Street has always taken a considered approach to trading opportunities and will continue to do so, as more cryptocurrency products emerge, we expect to be involved.

Jane Street Follows Other Well Known Wall Street Market Makers
The news also follows other big-name Wall Street firms who have been reportedly trading bitcoin or crypto-based exchange-traded notes and futures products. This year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein explained if clients want to trade BTC they will help facilitate. ?We?re clearing futures in bitcoins for some of our futures clients ? We?d clear them,? explains Blankfein. ?We?re a prime broker, and so if our clients are going to do it, we?re going to do it.?

Back in September of 2017, Jamie Dimon explained that bitcoin traders were ?stupid.? But the firm was caught red-handed trading BTC exchange-traded notes for clients. Further, the company has stated it is open to offering clients CME and Cboe bitcoin futures.

Jane Street is different than JP Morgan and Goldman as it uses the Ocaml programming language that helps the firm?s traders quickly execute trades in changing market conditions. The company has even released some open source code for its Ocaml libraries. Jane Street did not reveal to the press how it was actively trading cryptocurrencies.

A Memphis investment group featuring a prominent local philanthropist is under contract to sell the iconic One Commerce Square office tower to a New York-based real estate firm.

Memphis Commerce Square Partners is set to sell the 508,000-square-foot tower to Group RMC Corp., according to an application filed with the Downtown Memphis Commission's Center City Revenue Finance Corp. (CCRFC).

Memphis Commerce Square Partners consisted of Memphians J.R. ""Pitt"" Hyde, John Pontius, Robert Worthington, Terry Lynch, Karl Schledwitz, Gail Schledwitz and Gary Prosterman when it purchased the building for $7.5 million in late 2010.

At that time, Lynch said the following: ?We?re excited to have the opportunity to reposition this property and get it back into Memphians? hands after a couple of years of absentee ownership.?

Since purchasing the building, almost $19 million has been invested into it, according to building permits listed by the Shelby County Assessor of Property. It's current appraisal is $18.5 million.

This investment includes the recent preparation of space for Wunderlich Securities/B. Riley's new offices in the building, which can be viewed in the slideshow below.

Group RMC is a firm headquartered in New York City's One World Trade Center tower. Headed up by investor Ray Massa, Group RMC owns $1.6 billion worth of office buildings across North America, according to its website. Its lone holding locally is the 493,000-square-foot Southwind Office Center on Tournament Drive in southeast Memphis.

Massa will control and operate the One Commerce Square project, according to a letter to the CCRFC from Terence Gallagher, a partner with Columbus, Ohio-based law firm Gallagher Kavinsky & Burkhart, who is counsel representing the prospective buyer.

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company said it plans to relocate a large Charlotte operation to Massachusetts as part of a U.S.-wide consolidation project.

MassMutual expects to relocate its roughly 300 corporate employees in south Charlotte to Massachusetts by 2019, spokeswoman Laura Crisco told the Observer. Positions will go to either the company?s Springfield headquarters or Boston, she said.

Affected roles include those in accounting and finance, as well as call center and investment services, Crisco said. MassMutual sales and advisory offices are not impacted, she said.

The action is part of a MassMutual announcement this week of plans to expand the firm?s footprint in its home state, where it expects to increase its workforce by approximately 70 percent by the end of 2021. MassMutual said it plans to retain other offices only in New York, Phoenix and Amherst, Mass.


Enter Email Address

In 2016, MassMutual announced plans to buy MetLife?s U.S. retail adviser force, which included an operation employing about 200 in Ballantyne Corporate Park. Prior to that acquisition, MassMutual did not have operations in Charlotte, Crisco said.

MetLife was seeking to sell the force as part of the insurer?s plan to separate itself from a large portion of its U.S. retail business, which the company headquartered in Ballantyne in exchange for millions of dollars in state incentives awarded in 2013.

New York-based MetLife spun off that retail business last year as Brighthouse Financial, which is headquartered in Charlotte.

In this week?s announcement, MassMutual said it was investing nearly $300 million in its expansion in Massachusetts, where it will add 2,000 jobs over the next four years. That includes 1,500 at its corporate headquarters in Springfield, in addition to building a new Boston campus.

The firm said it is expanding in Massachusetts because the state provides it with everything it needs to best serve its policyowners in the future, including a highly skilled workforce.

Not affected by this week?s announcement are the Charlotte operations of Barings, an asset manager that is part of MassMutual. Crisco said the Barings operation in Charlotte has about 450 employees.

In November, Barings held a ribbon-cutting for its new corporate headquarters tower at the corner of Third and South Tryon streets, overlooking Romare Bearden Park and BB&T Ballpark.

Bitt, a Barbados-based fintech company, announced this week it closed its Series A investment round with an investment from retail giant Overstock.com of $16 million, placing the company?s valuation at $50 million. Founded in 2013, Bitt states it utilizes distributed ledger technology to improve speed, efficiency, and significantly reduces the costs of the payment system:

?The Bitt Wallet is the sole consumer access point to the entire Bitt ecosystem. It allows users to send and receive money globally, and process transactions from the convenience of their mobile device or computer. Users can simply enter the receiving party?s Bitt address (or have them scan a randomly generated QR code in person) to send money. This peer-to-peer money transfer system doesn?t rely on complicated correspondence communication chains or any centralized authority figure. All of the transactions are approved and held accountable by the Blockchain.?

Speaking about the investment in Bitt, Overstock.com CEO, Patrick M. Bryne, stated:

?Bitt has a vision for the Caribbean of frictionless mobile cash, beginning with central banks transparently issuing digital fiat which is then exchanged using a blockchain mechanism (with proper regulatory oversight). We respect and endorse that vision, and share a common desire to see online consensual exchange flourish globally.?

Bitt CEO and Co-Founder, Gabriel Abed, also commented:

?Regional small businesses find it financially prohibitive to offer online payment options to consumers and this places a drag on entrepreneurism in the Caribbean. Our aim is to use cryptography and digital ledger technology to turn our regional citizens into global citizens, giving them the ability to send or receive money directly via their phones, in seconds, from all corners of the globe.?

Oliver Gale, Bitt CFO and Co-Founder, then noted:

?Bitt?s financial technology revolution will bring to consumers a faster, better, cheaper and more traceable way of banking ? and we now have a new, multi-billion dollar backed investor to help make this vision a reality. Bitt is bringing modern financial solutions to a region long denied efficient settlement systems.?

Bitt added it will use the newly secured funding to further develop its software suite which includes a digital asset exchange, a mobile money wallet, a remittance platform, and merchant payment processing tools. Additionally, Bitt will rapidly expand, growing its staff to meet the goals of providing a top-quality service that will encompass the entire Caribbean region.",Ultimate parent is engaged in blockchain/ICO/cryptto currency and adds to information relative to growth in this sector

Ed Cofrancesco of International Assets Advisory explains why he believes some advisors should get a second chance.
By Emily Zulz | July 13, 2018 at 09:53 AM
 red flags
Ed Cofrancesco is a man that believes in second chances.

Cofrancesco started in the industry when he was 16 years old and still in high school. He is now president and CEO of International Assets Advisory.
International Assets Advisory is an independent broker-dealer and RIA that has been serving financial advisors and institutions since 1982. The current owners, including Cofrancesco, acquired the firm nearly 12 years ago. The firm has an international focus, which includes investing internationally for U.S. investors as well as investing in the U.S. for non-U.S. investors.

Ed Cofrancesco Ed Cofrancesco
?I?m a stupid street kid from Brooklyn. I didn?t finish college ? [and now] I have more money than I ever thought I was going to have in my life,? he told ThinkAdvisor.

The way Cofrancesco sees it, his whole career has shaped who he is.
?One of the things I believe in is giving people second chances,? he said.

By this, he means he?s not afraid to bring into the firm advisors or brokers that might have regulatory or disciplinary actions on their record.

?We have hired our fair share of advisors who have had issues,? he said.

International Assets Advisory, which is a midsize firm, has about 160 advisors. Of that, Cofrancesco says 35% to 40% might have something on their record.

?Some of them maintain 100% of their innocence to this day, and based on circumstances I?ve seen in some cases I had every reason to believe that they were telling the truth and believe in that now,? Cofrancesco explained. ?Others were small technicalities that got blown into big issues with their firm. Others may have done something wrong at the time and didn?t realize they were doing something wrong.?

Then there are the others that have flat-out lied and made it sound like they were innocent when they were not, Cofrancesco said.

?We?re really good at sorting that out through our review process when we hire them,? Cofrancesco added. ?And even then, I?d say maybe one out of 10 slips through, but within a year or so we can determine [they lied] ? and bye-bye.?

A 2017 study by Reuters with the assistance of Columbia University Law School identified nearly 48% of the 140 total brokers at the time at International Assets Advisory as having flags from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The FINRA flags that the study examined included regulatory sanctions, customer complaints that resulted in a payment, criminal cases that resulted in a plea agreement or conviction, and bankruptcies.

?We?ve gotten some bad press over the years,? Cofrancesco admitted. ?If you look at raw numbers versus other firms, we?re always in the top 20 in terms of firms percentage-wise that have people with marks on their license. But then you have to look at the marks my advisors have. It?s a quantitative analysis but not a qualitative analysis.?

While the firm may rank high in regards to brokers with a regulatory history, Cofrancesco is quick to point out the firm has had a low number of FINRA actions in its 36-year history ? and zero in the time that Cofrancesco has been in charge.

International Assets Advisory has seven disclosures, and the most recent one one was almost 18 years ago.

?So, you compare our regulatory history to our peers, I?ve been quoted in the past as saying ?exemplary? ? because it is,? Cofrancesco said. ?I don?t have time for nonsense. But, I also believe in second chances.?

Cofrancesco gave ThinkAdvisor an example of one advisor he gave a second chance.

?This guy worked for a very well-known national firm ? [and] his firm required that when you do a financial plan, the client sign off on the request of the financial plan,? he told ThinkAdvisor. ?That was just the rule of the firm.?

In one instance, he was doing a financial plan for a client and the sales associate working with him was supposed to get the client to sign the document.

?[The sales associate] realized she hadn?t gotten them to sign,? Cofrancesco said. ?She calls the client ? they had just left the office ? [and] asks them to come back. And they say, ?Can?t you just sign it for me???

And she did ? unbeknownst to this advisor, Cofrancesco said.

Several months later, it came out in an internal audit. This advisor explained he didn?t know anything about it, the sales associate confessed, and the auditor gave the firm a slap on the wrist, according to Cofrancesco.

Several months after that, the advisor left for another firm. His old firm opened an investigation.

FINRA eventually offered the advisor a $5,000 fine and 30-day suspension. The new firm then fired him, saying he didn?t disclose that he had an ongoing investigation.

?When this guy called me up when he got cut from his firm ? someone told him to call Ed ? [he was] crying,? Cofrancesco said. ?Thought his life was over. How was he ever going to make a living again??

To Cofrancesco, though, this was one of his best ? and most trustworthy ? hires.

?If I was to get hit by a train tomorrow, I?ve told my wife, he?s the guy you should put our money with to take care of you the rest of your life,? he said. ?That?s how trustworthy this guy is!?","Although the information in the article was known to Surveillance staff, brocasting to publc was of added risk/concern.

FINRA says Interactive Brokers ?internally identified the problems, yet did not revise its supervisory systems for more than three years.""
By Janet Levaux | August 20, 2018 at 03:29 PM
 Regulators fined Interactive Brokers, an automated electronic brokerage firm, $5.5 million for violations and supervisory failures tied to short sale practices, or Regulation SHO, from 2012 to 2015.

According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Interactive was aware of its supervisory issues but did not implement any changes until mid-2015. As a result, the broker-dealer did not close out more than 2,300 fails-to-deliver, while accepting and executing short orders in securities without first borrowing (or arranging to borrow) the security roughly 28,000 times.
Plus, Interactive let over 7,400 short sale orders be executed or displayed in covered securities at a price less than or equal to the current best bid.

?Firms that are aware of deficiencies in their supervisory systems must promptly remediate them,? said Susan Schroeder, head of FINRA?s Enforcement Department. ?In this case, the firm internally identified the problems, yet did not revise its supervisory systems for more than three years, creating the potential for negative impact to the markets and investor harm.?
Reg SHO requires that, after completion of a short sale transaction, firms much deliver the shares on the settlement date or take action to close out the ?failure to deliver? shares by purchasing or borrowing the securities. If such actions are not taken, the firm may not accept more short sale orders in the security without first borrowing or arranging to borrow the security.

The rules also prohibits firms from executing or displaying short sales via a ?covered security? at a price that is less than or equal to the current best bid, when the price of the security has fallen by 10% or more in one day.

Leading cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain company Coinbase has been investing in strategic areas to make it the partner of choice for the much-anticipated wave of institutional investors.

If 2017 was the year of the rise of cryptocurrency prices, then 2018 is the year that opens the door for institutional investment.

Following the massive rise of the cryptocurrency and ICO markets last year, the next natural step for the industry is the entry of institutional investors. The move is considered to take the industry to a whole new level and put it alongside the traditional stock and forex markets.

However, the big boys of the financial world require certain infrastructure in place before making an investment, most notably:

Regulation ? (most) institutionals won?t invest a penny in unregulated markets/companies
Security and custody ? insitutionals need to know their assets are safe and sound
Liquidity ? big boys have big money so illiquid markets aren?t attractive to them
Cryptocurrency companies have been working and putting things in place that would support the investors when they eventually come in. They are doing this by rolling out products and services that would make things easier for the investors.

One of such companies is Coinbase, which is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. by volume and popularity.

Recent strategic investments by Coinbase
San-Francisco based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been planning to ensure that it leads the industry and become the preferred destination for institutional investors.

Coinbase Custody
One of such moves is the launch of its Coinbase Custody service. Coinbase Custody was launched with the aim of tackling the primary concern of institutional investors, which is security.

The service makes use of a wide range of security measures such as on-chain segregation of crypto assets, offline, multi-sig and geographically distributed transaction protection and robust cold storage auditing and reporting.

The service is secured via an SEC-compliant and FINRA-member independent broker-dealer, Electronic Transaction Clearing (ETC).

Asides that, Coinbase has also made some smart acquisitions that have made it a very favorable spot for investors.

Coinbase becomes regulated broker-dealer
The exchange has recently acquired firms such as Digital Wealth LLC, Venovate Marketplace Inc., and Keystone Capital Corp.

Venovate and Keystone have already been registered with the SEC and FINRA as broker-dealers. Digital Wealth, on the other hand, has an SEC-registered investment adviser license, with Venovate having the license as an alternative trading system.

Coinbase also digital identity startup, Distributed Systems which is working on helping people maintain complete control over their digital identities, thus ensuring that their personal information remains safe.

Onboarding finance veteran Jeff Horowitz
Perhaps one of the biggest moves made by Coinbase is hiring Jeff Horowitz, who was a former employee at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.

Horowitz has been named as the Chief Compliance Officer at Coinbase, as the exchange looks to navigate compliance complexities on a global scale. This move is a very good one, as he brings a wealth of experience in policy, financial services, and corporate governance.

As he settles into his new role, Horowitz is expected to work on issues that would see institutional investors choose Coinbase over the others.

As someone who knows the institutional world, he is expected to bring employ people in hedge funds to help him run his department.

According to some experts in the field, it would make sense for Horowitz to focus his attention on derivatives on crypto assets such as funds, ETFs, and futures.

What is an institutional investor?
These entities typically pool money and invest it on behalf of its investors (pension funds, hedge funds, etc) or for themselves (insurance companies, banks, etc.).

Institutional investors include:

Insurance companies
Banks
Pension funds
Hedge funds
Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
Endowment funds
Mutual funds

By Alex Padalka August 16, 2018
Massachusetts? top securities cop has charged a Los Angeles broker and his firm with improper trading in unit investment trusts, InvestmentNews writes.

StockCross Financial Services and Peter Cunningham allegedly recommended that clients buy and sell the UITs before they matured, which allegedly resulted in more commissions for the firm and the broker while causing losses for clients, the Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin?s office said, according to the publication. The regulator also charged StockCross with failing to supervise Cunningham, InvestmentNews writes.

Cunningham and Beverly Hills, Calif.-based StockCross allegedly earned $750,000 in commissions from short-term trading in UITs just from their Massachusetts clients, which make up 30% of the firm?s customers, Galvin said, according to the publication. At the same time, Cunningham was allegedly so far in debt that his wages were being garnished and he had been served with at least two home foreclosure notices, according to a statement from Galvin?s office cited by InvestmentNews. The regulator is seeking a cease-and-desist order, censure, restitution to clients and an administrative fine, according to the publication. In addition, Galvin?s office is seeking to revoke Cunningham?s right to practice and to force StockFirst to bring an independent consultant to assess its supervisory procedures, InvestmentNews writes.

Cunningham first registered with Finra in 1994 and joined StockCross in 2002, according to his BrokerCheck profile.

He?s currently listed as registered at StockCross and at Muriel Siebert & Co., which is also based in Beverly Hills, according to BrokerCheck.

Recently the State of Oregon, Department of Consumer and Business Services Division of Financial Regulation, has entered a cease and desist order against Respondents CETERA ADVISORS, LLC, and GEORGE MERHOFF. The Department found that two (unnamed) customers of Respondents were sold large concentrated positions in energy in their managed accounts to customers who did not understand the risks associated with them.

Respondents were ordered to pay a $70,000 fine and a suspended fine of $35,000 if they could prove that MERHOFF is being adequately supervised. The findings already made by the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation mirror a similar pattern of misconduct in the latest lawsuit filed by attorney Lars Soreide, Esq., of Soreide Law Group on behalf of his Klamath Falls clients.

In the seven lawsuits filed by Soreide Law Group, it was alleged that many of the customers of Merhoff were completely reliant on his advice and had managed accounts. It is alleged that, MERHOFF, for some clients, made large concentrated positions in oil and gas related investments. MERHOFF concentrated many of his customer's accounts in high-risk oil and gas investments, including but not limited to: Linn Energy, PenGrowth Energy Corp, Seadrill Partners, Energplus, Cliffs Natural Resources, Teekay Partners, and Vale S.A.

MERHOFF has racked up twenty four (24) reported customer complaints on his U4. The significance of MERHOFF'S customer complaints is underscored in FINRA NOTICE to MEMBERS 03-49. In 2003, FINRA conducted a review of the CRD's of all 663,000 registered representatives, only 2,751 (.41%) had been the subject of (3) or more customer complaints. In other words MERHOFF's customer complaints rank him in the top one-hundredth percent of all registered representatives for customer complaints.  The vast majority of the reported conduct all relates to similar conduct at issue here involving material misrepresentations and negligent recommendations involving deceptive trade practice allegations.

The Klamath Falls clients of Soreide Law Group allege that there was no hedging or stop loss strategy implemented in the accounts. Most of these losses were to irreplaceable retirement savings.  Over-concentrated positions in risky oil and gas investments are totally unsuitable for a conservative portfolio. Many investors represented by Soreide Law Group were looking to invest instable income producing investments and not speculate with their irreplaceable life savings.

GREENVILLE, S.C., Sept. 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A new series of public briefings by financial educator, author and retirement income specialist, Dan Carson, educates retirees against retirement mistakes and costly missteps.

Americans over age 65 are facing stiff challenges to retire and stay retired. Retired executives, professionals and business owners are invited to a free, private briefing to find out strategies to reduce income taxes and estate taxes on their IRAs, 401(k)s and pensions.

""Today's hard-working retirees face significant challenges and obstacles to enjoying the reward for a lifetime of labor and sacrifice,"" said Dan Carson, ChFC?. ""If you are doing the same things financially that everyone else is doing and find yourself thinking that you are going to be fine during retirement, you may need to rethink your position."" 

This new series of briefings educates and equips retirees against the little-known mistakes and costly missteps that can derail their retirement. The fast-paced, 77-minute presentation explores the 7 major retiree fears and concerns: living too long, running out of money, taxes, inflation, the federal government's deficit, health care costs, and not passing on family values.

Carson continues, ""AARP reported that 2 out of 3 older Americans fear running out of money more than dying. Imagine being 75 years old, in great health, full of life, and running out of money. The fear of running out of money is not unfounded, yet retirees deserve to live with greater peace and freedom in retirement.""

Besides taxes, running afoul of IRS retirement account rules can cost retirees a bundle. According to Forbes, ""Americans paid an estimated $5.8 billion in penalties on retirement account withdrawals. That's in addition to the regular tax owed on those withdrawals.""

In addition, the Wall Street Journal reported that, ""Uncle Sam is about to get a lot tougher on individual retirement account mistakes?and that could trip up investors who aren't careful."" Source: The Wall Street Journal. ""IRA Rules Get Trickier."" June 22, 2012.

During the briefing, Carson shows attendees strategies to:

Create substantial income tax deductions.
Avoid double taxation on your ""targeted"" retirement accounts.
Potentially avoid capital gains taxes on stocks, bonds and real estate.
Reduce and even eliminate income taxes on your IRA and 401(k).
Convert unused assets into an income you can't outlive.
Save taxes using strategies the IRS and congress want you to use.
The briefings are held at noon and early evening and are by invitation only.

""There will be nothing to buy at this briefing, just valuable and usable information. Every attendee will receive a free, no obligation action guide to help them avoid the costliest retirement mistakes,"" said Carson.

""I believe that people who have worked hard for their money and sacrificed for retirement deserve to enjoy greater peace and freedom in retirement, not merely to survive. That's why I educate retirees about their options. I hope people take advantage of our free Briefings. They are filled with retirement nuggets and tips and attendees have a fun time,"" said Carson.

Shares of MetLife moved nearly 1 percent lower Monday after it said it would sell its U.S. retail advisor force to another top insurer.

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance on Monday agreed to acquire MetLife's Premier Client Group to broaden its geographic reach and expand its dominance in the life insurance industry, the companies said in a release. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but are ""not material"" to MassMutual, the statement said.

The two companies had been reported to be in talks over the unit ? which encompasses more than 40 sales and advisory operations and about 4,000 advisors.

If 2017 was the year of the rise of cryptocurrency prices, then 2018 is the year that opens the door for institutional investment.

Following the massive rise of the cryptocurrency and ICO markets last year, the next natural step for the industry is the entry of institutional investors. The move is considered to take the industry to a whole new level and put it alongside the traditional stock and forex markets.

However, the big boys of the financial world require certain infrastructure in place before making an investment, most notably:

Regulation ? (most) institutionals won?t invest a penny in unregulated markets/companies
Security and custody ? insitutionals need to know their assets are safe and sound
Liquidity ? big boys have big money so illiquid markets aren?t attractive to them
Cryptocurrency companies have been working and putting things in place that would support the investors when they eventually come in. They are doing this by rolling out products and services that would make things easier for the investors.

One of such companies is Coinbase, which is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. by volume and popularity.

Recent strategic investments by Coinbase
San-Francisco based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been planning to ensure that it leads the industry and become the preferred destination for institutional investors.

Coinbase Custody
One of such moves is the launch of its Coinbase Custody service. Coinbase Custody was launched with the aim of tackling the primary concern of institutional investors, which is security.

The service makes use of a wide range of security measures such as on-chain segregation of crypto assets, offline, multi-sig and geographically distributed transaction protection and robust cold storage auditing and reporting.

The service is secured via an SEC-compliant and FINRA-member independent broker-dealer, Electronic Transaction Clearing (ETC).

Asides that, Coinbase has also made some smart acquisitions that have made it a very favorable spot for investors.

Coinbase becomes regulated broker-dealer
The exchange has recently acquired firms such as Digital Wealth LLC, Venovate Marketplace Inc., and Keystone Capital Corp.

Venovate and Keystone have already been registered with the SEC and FINRA as broker-dealers. Digital Wealth, on the other hand, has an SEC-registered investment adviser license, with Venovate having the license as an alternative trading system.

Coinbase also digital identity startup, Distributed Systems which is working on helping people maintain complete control over their digital identities, thus ensuring that their personal information remains safe.

Onboarding finance veteran Jeff Horowitz
Perhaps one of the biggest moves made by Coinbase is hiring Jeff Horowitz, who was a former employee at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.

Horowitz has been named as the Chief Compliance Officer at Coinbase, as the exchange looks to navigate compliance complexities on a global scale. This move is a very good one, as he brings a wealth of experience in policy, financial services, and corporate governance.

As he settles into his new role, Horowitz is expected to work on issues that would see institutional investors choose Coinbase over the others.

As someone who knows the institutional world, he is expected to bring employ people in hedge funds to help him run his department.

According to some experts in the field, it would make sense for Horowitz to focus his attention on derivatives on crypto assets such as funds, ETFs, and futures.

What is an institutional investor?
These entities typically pool money and invest it on behalf of its investors (pension funds, hedge funds, etc) or for themselves (insurance companies, banks, etc.).

Asian shares mostly lower after topsy-turvy day on Wall St,https://wtop.com/national/2018/05/us-stocks-edge-lower-as-pfizer-and-under-armour-sink/,https://wtop.com,No,Market,"BANGKOK (AP) ? Shares are mixed in Asia after a topsy-turvy May Day session on Wall Street, where most benchmarks recovered from early losses as Apple led a rally in technology companies.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan?s Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.3 percent to 22,444.09 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.6 percent to 30,622.73. The Shanghai Composite index shed 0.4 percent to 3,070.45 and South Korea?s Kospi gave up 0.4 percent to 2,506.55. Australia?s S&P ASX 200 advanced 0.5 percent to 6,045.70. Shares were lower in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.

WALL STREET: U.S. stocks clawed back early losses Tuesday as the rally in technology and smaller, domestically-focused companies helped offset a slump in household goods makers and industrial companies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 354 points, then recovered to close down 64. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3 percent to 2,654.80. The Dow slipped 0.3 percent to 24,099, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 0.9 percent to 7,130.55. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 0.5 percent to 1,550.33.




TRADE: Top trade officials from the U.S. are due to meet in Beijing with senior Chinese leaders to discuss ways to defuse worsening tensions over the trade imbalance. The Trump administration decision Monday to delay a decision on imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports sidesteps a potential trade battle with Europe for now, but European Union leaders want a permanent exemption and say the uncertainty caused by delays is bad for business.

ANALYST?S VIEWPOINT: ?The optimism stemming from the delay of metal tariffs in the U.S. ? appears to have dissipated into today?s session with trade tensions also looming ahead. As investors look ahead to the meeting between US and Chinese delegates into the end of the week, both the trade and commerce representatives in the U.S. spoke of challenges,? Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.

U.S. ECONOMY: U.S. manufacturing grew at a slower pace in April, according to the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers. Many factories said shortages of workers and skills affected their productivity. Meanwhile the Commerce Department said construction spending fell in March as home building dropped sharply.

SAMSUNG BIOLOGICS: South Korean biotech company Samsung Biologics Co.?s shares plunged as much as 11 percent in Seoul after a regulator said Samsung breached accounting rules. Samsung said it will defend itself and has abided by accounting rules. At stake is whether or not the way Samsung Biologics evaluated the value of its affiliate Samsung Bioepis violated rules.

ENERGY: Overnight, oil prices gave up some of their recent gains. But they bounced back Wednesday in Asia, with benchmark U.S. crude gaining 27 cents to $67.52 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 1.9 percent to $67.25 a barrel in New York on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, added 7 cents to $73.20 per barrel. It dropped 2.1 percent to $73.13 a barrel in London.

CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 109.74 Japanese yen from 109.88 yen. The euro rose to $1.2004 from $1.1993.

Charles Schwab: Tax-Loss Harvesting Trades Up in Volatile Market,https://www.investopedia.com/news/charles-schwab-taxloss-harvesting-trades-volatile-market/,https://www.investopedia.com,No,Fraud,"Volatility is back with a vengeance, and as a result, so is tax-loss harvesting. While many think this tax-smart strategy is only a fourth quarter move, with stocks whipsawing between up and down days throughout the year, Charles Schwab's David Koenig, chief investment strategist for Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, said there are lots of opportunities to pair winning stocks with losing ones to offset capital gains outside of the end of the year.

""It's really designed to take advantage of the natural volatility in the market throughout the year,"" said  Koenig in an interview with Investopedia. In 2017, when volatility was low and stocks were setting new highs seemingly every month, there were fewer opportunities to engage in tax-loss harvesting. But with volatility rising in 2018, the ability to implement this tax savings strategy has increased. ""In early February, around the time of the correction, the number of tax-loss harvesting trades made for clients jumped significantly,"" said Koenig. ""That said, we also had tax-loss harvesting trades for clients in 2017 and every month since 2015. Periods of higher volatility present more opportunity.""

[Check out Investopedia's TD Ameritrade review to learn about this low-cost broker with powerful charting tools.]

When it comes to tax-loss harvesting, there are rules that investors have to be aware of such as the wash sale rule. Under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, investors can't claim a tax loss on a stock they sold and then repurchased within 30 days. The IRS looks at all of the investor's holdings to determine if he or she broke the rule, and if it finds that one stock sale/purchase did so, it will be disallowed. Furthermore, while it can be easy to spot winners and losers in stock portfolios, it can get tougher to identify those opportunities for ETF investors.

To aid in that and to prevent clients from running afoul of the wash sale rule, the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio will do the work for clients, using algorithms that automatically check every portfolio each day for rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting opportunities. Take a large-cap U.S. stock exchange-traded fund (ETF) as an example. If that ETF has a big enough decline, it will be sold off to offset any capital gains for the year. To prevent the client from losing exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks during the 30 days that the IRS doesn't allow repurchase of that same ETF, Schwab Intelligent Portfolio will invest in another ETF that gives the client the same exposure but doesn't run afoul of the wash sale rules.

"Record YoY Fee Decline in 2017 Driven by Vanguard, Discount Brokerages: Morningstar",https://www.investopedia.com/news/record-yoy-fee-decline-2017-driven-vanguard-discount-brokerages-morningstar/,,Yes,Liquidity,"Expenses on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds saw their steepest year-over-year decline in 2017 thanks to Vanguard and rivals Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and BlackRock, all of which stepped up the fee reductions in 2017.

According to Morningstar, the asset-weighted average expense ratio across funds was 0.52% in 2017, marking an 8% year-over-year decline. Morningstar said in a report that this marked the steepest year-over-year decline since the company started tracking asset-weighted average fees in 2000. As a result of the fee reductions, Morningstar estimates that investors saved around $4 billion in expenses in 2017 alone. The fund ranking company noted that funds with expense ratios that were above 1.10% accounted for under 10% of the assets invested in U.S. equity funds last year.

[Check out Investopedia's TD Ameritrade review to learn about this low-cost broker with powerful charting tools.]

Breaking it down into categories, Morningstar found that the asset-weighted average fee for U.S. equity funds declined 9% to 0.45% last year, while taxable bond funds saw asset-weighted average fees decline 7% to 0.44%, and international equity funds saw fees decline 8% to 0.64%.

""Declines in the asset-weighted average fees were more pronounced among passively managed funds thanks to strong flows into the lowest-cost funds, as well as fee cuts by some asset managers for widely held broad index funds,"" wrote Morningstar. ""In aggregate, passively managed funds exhibited asset-weighted expense ratio declines of 7% from 2016. International equity funds exhibited the largest declines among passive funds, whose asset-weighted average fees fell 9% to reach 0.23%.""

On the active side, the decline in fees was driven by large outflows from pricey funds and large inflows into cheaper ones. What's more, last year, more actively managed funds lowered their fees, resulting in asset-weighted fees for actively managed funds declining 4%. It marked the largest year-over-year dip in more than 10 years.

How To Find And Select Undervalued Fixed-Income Securities,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4195297-find-select-undervalued-fixed-income-securities,https://seekingalpha.com/,No,Market,"

Summary


?This is an educational article regarding the process of finding and selecting under-priced fixed-income securities that trade on the stock exchange.

?It argues for using relative valuation when making a buy recommendation on a particular fixed-income security.

?BofI Holding's 6.25% Subordinated Notes maturing on 2/28/2026 are used as a case study in using relative valuation to find a very undervalued fixed-income security.


Overview

In the world of fixed-income investing, there is no objective value, only relative value. There is no interest rate (yield) that one can say is right for a particular security. For example, preferred stocks currently sell at yields that aren't much different from yields that existed when the 10-Year Treasury yield was half of what it is now. So are preferred stocks overpriced now or were they underpriced when the 10-Year Treasury had a significantly lower yield?

My major gripe regarding some Seeking Alpha authors who promote fixed-income ideas (preferred stocks or bonds) is that they use an objective valuation approach rather than a relative valuation approach in their security selection process. They provide information about the company that issued the fixed-income security that they are promoting, and about the details of the fixed-income security that they write about (yield, price, call date), and expect that is enough to make an investment decision. However, no evidence is provided that their recommended security is a relatively better value than other similar securities issued by other similar companies. Sometimes I find the recommendations to be relatively overpriced and inferior.

Tips For Finding and Selecting Undervalued Fixed-Income Securities

1) One of the lessons I have learned from my 20 years of trading fixed-income securities is that the best values are in unrated fixed-income securities. You can generally get preferred stock and baby bond safety ratings from Moody's and S&P from QuantumOnline.com, but when checking safety ratings at QuantumOnline, you will discover that a large number of fixed-income securities are not rated. This only means that the company has decided not to pay the rating agencies to rate their fixed-income securities. But many unrated securities are extremely safe. Despite this fact, many mutual funds and other institutional investors have instructions not to buy unrated securities. Therefore, unrated securities are often underpriced due to lack of buying from ""big money"" and the fact that they are avoided by those who do not want to take the time (or have the knowledge) to examine the safety of the company themselves. In my opinion, it is well worth taking the time to look into unrated securities as you will greatly outperform the benchmarks by finding the unrated gems. Learning the basics of reading a balance sheet will go a long way in becoming a successful fixed-income investor.


2) For companies that are rated smaller companies tend to receive lower ratings simply because they are small despite the fact that they may have better balance sheets and better business prospects than more highly rated companies. So bargains tend to exist more in the fixed-income securities issued by smaller companies.

3) For ""stock exchange traded"" bonds, there may be bonds issued by the same company that trade on the ""bond exchange"". This gives you a chance to see if there is a relative mispricing between the company's exchange traded bonds and the company's bond exchange traded bonds. A couple of examples of this are comparing the ""stock exchange traded"" PSEC 2024 bonds (PBB) with the many PSEC bonds that trade on the ""bond exchange"". Right now PBB looks like a good relative value. An extreme mispricing can be found when comparing the R.R. Donnelley (NASDAQ:RRD) trust security (PYS) which contains the same R.R. Donnelley bonds that trade on the ""bond exchange"" - the 6.625% bonds maturing 2029. PYS is extremely underpriced relative to the identical ""bond exchange"" traded bond. Bonds traded on the stock exchange are often better values than those traded on the bond exchange, and they are also often more liquid and easier to trade.

4) This article mainly focuses on bonds. For more information on evaluating preferred stocks to find mispriced bargains, see some of my recent Seeking Alpha articles here, here, and here where relative valuation is used to document the mispriced preferred stock bargains. Additionally, one important thing you can do in evaluating preferred stocks is to look at the yield on the bonds that have been issued by the same company to help get an idea of safety of the company and the relative valuation of the preferred stock versus the bond.

U.S. government debt yields fell slightly on Monday ahead of a week of large Treasury auctions and inflation data.
 
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was slightly lower at around 2.945 percent at 4:06 p.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 3.093 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

This week the Treasury Department will auction $34 billion of three?year notes (+$3 billion vs. the previous auction), $26 billion of 10?year notes (+$4 billion, and a record per BMO Capital Markets), and $18 billion of 30?year bonds (+$4 billion). Inflation data in the form of producer prices and consumer prices are expected Thursday and Friday, receptively.

Markets around the globe pulled back Monday, as concerns surrounding trade tensions continued. Last week, China said it was ready to retaliate with tariffs on around $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, amid a mounting trade war with the States. Beijing added that import taxes would be within the range of 5 percent to 25 percent in rates, with many of the goods listed linked to agriculture.

The U.S. administration revealed last Wednesday that President Donald Trump had spoken with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and asked him to consider increasing the proposed levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods up to 25 percent, from 10 percent.

Markets in Asia and Europe came under slight pressure on Monday morning, as investors awaited more news on the retaliatory tariffs.

While no major speeches by the U.S. Federal Reserve are scheduled to take place Monday, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard spoke with CNBC on the first trading day of the week.

""The positioning here is that the other countries are all free trade and the U.S. is not. If that's really what we're saying then just drop all tariffs and all non-tariff barriers. Go down to zero. That would be better outcome for the whole world,"" Bullard told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

The U.S. government reported on Friday that payroll growth slowed in July.

How to get regular income after retirement,https://www.livemint.com/Money/QQ60Q8MWtWCfSE5QFBNO8O/How-to-get-regular-income-after-retirement.html,https://www.livemint.com/,No,Market,"With rising life expectancy in India, post-retirement life span is now longer than what it was earlier. According to the latest World Bank data, life expectancy in India has risen from 53-54 years in 1980 to 67-70 years in 2015. Living longer has a direct impact on your financial preparedness for retirement. While many will have an accumulated pension to fall back on, the truth is an annual price rise or inflation of 5-6% combined with the prospect of potentially living for another 20-25 years post retirement can become an expensive outcome.

A basic need for retirees is regular income. You need to take that accumulated pension amount, other savings you have piled up over the years and assets you have created and make them into a viable stream of regular income.






Large expenses like medical contingencies need to be accounted for before you estimate your regular income need, else these expenses can eat into your retirement savings. ?We find that many who retire haven?t planned any medical insurance. With health costs rising, this is a risk that needs to be covered. If both spouses are not fit enough for mediclaim application to be accepted, the one who can should cover medical expenses through a policy. In its absence, a larger pool of funds will have to be kept aside for medical emergencies,? said Vivek Rege, founder and chief executive, VR Wealth Advisors Pvt. Ltd.

Financial savings and assets

Among traditional investment choices for senior citizens are bank fixed deposits, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) and National Savings Certificate (NSC). Bank FDs give senior citizens an advantage by giving an interest rate that is 25-50 basis points higher than what other individuals get. The 8.3% interest on SCSS is also attractive. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.






After allocating to traditional investments and pension plans which cater to capital preservation, consider mutual fund investments as well?they are liquid, they help you get regular payouts and let you access the lump sum in case of any emergency. For debt funds, your holding period can be between 6 months and 3 years, equity and balanced funds will require you to remain invested for at least 5 years.

Yogita Dand, Mumbai-based certified financial planner and co-founder, AskY Financial Services, said, ?Invest in SCSS and Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana, in which you can invest up to ? 15 lakh. With the rest, create systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs) from investments in large-cap equity or balanced funds.? An SWP from an equity-oriented fund works if you have invested in equity before and have accumulated profits. Given the need for capital preservation post retirement, if one does not have any equity exposure, then SWP should be done from short-term income funds or other fixed income funds that give stable returns.

Physical assets

Traditionally, most Indian families invest in a house. In many cases, people own a house but have inadequate cash flow to meet their expenses or lifestyle, but still do not want to move to a new smaller house or on rent. For such persons, there is reverse mortgage.

To opt for reverse mortgage, you must be the home owner and above 60 years of age. It?s like mortgaging your house to the bank, and getting a loan which comes to you as regular payouts. The eligibility depends on age, value of the property, interest rates and tenure of payout. The tenure can be for up to 20 years; the longer the tenure, the lower will be the payout. 






Punjab National Bank, for example, pays ? 435 per lakh per month and ? 101 per lakh per month for a tenure of 10 and 20 years, respectively. For a ? 80 lakh loan, this will come to a monthly payout of ? 34,800 for 10 years and ? 8,080 for 20 years. The current rate is about 11.35% per annum, and is revised every five years.

Even if the tenure gets exhausted, you can continue living in the house. On death, legal heirs can keep the house by repaying the loan with interest. Else, bank can sell the house to recover the dues and pay the remaining to the legal heirs.

It?s been a decade since reverse mortgage was introduced in India, but there are few takers for it. ?There is lack of awareness, neither the government nor the lenders ever tried to make it popular. Low payout, lack of understanding and complex process of borrowing are other deterrents,? said Manoj Pandey, director, Mainstream Investments Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Delhi-based financial planning and wealth management firm. 

What you should do

Remember that structuring a SWP, choosing appropriate funds or even deciding to go for a reverse mortgage is not simple.

Your mix of fixed-return products like FDs, small savings schemes and annuities and market-linked products like debt and equity mutual funds will depend on your existing savings pile and your need for capital preservation. 






Also, fixed return products work best if you are in the 10% or 20% income tax bracket. For those paying 30% plus income tax, a mix of mutual funds is more efficient. Don?t lock all your money in locked-in products like deposits, bonds and annuities.

AxeTrading Looks To Expand,https://www.marketsmedia.com/axetrading-looks-to-expand/,https://www.marketsmedia.com/,No,Market,"AxeTrading, which provides fixed income trading technology, is aiming to expand in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America over the next year as more buy-side firms adopt the firm?s execution management system.

The firm launched in 2009 and is focused on providing an EMS for asset managers who have been forced to become less reliant on liquidity from the sellside and are also increasingly looking to participate in an all-to-all trading model, where they have to make prices.

Mark Watters, CCO and co-founder of AxeTrading, told Markets Media: ?In the next 12 months we expect to open an office in North America, continue to expand in Asia Pacific and hopefully have our first customer in Latin America. In addition, a number of buy-side firms are expected to have adopted our EMS for fixed income.?

He added that three large asset managers recently chose AxeTrading?s fixed income EMS rather than adapting their equities platform. Axe Trading has also been targeting emerging markets and fixed income firms who are likely to become more prominent as regional players.

For example, South African?s Nedbank became the first bank to transact on the country?s new ?ETP? government bond electronic trading platform which went live on July 18. Nedbank and several other ETP participant banks use AxeTrader, the firm?s flagship platform.


Mark Watters, AxeTrading

?In South Africa we pitched to five local banks who did not have their own fixed income systems and four took our solution,? added Watters.

MiFID II

In Europe MiFID II, which came into force at the start of this year, extended best execution requirements from equities into fixed income for the first time. Watters thinks the real technical response to MiFID II is only just beginning.

?For example, one of our clients has just decided to become a systematic internaliser and so needs a new technology solution,? he said.

MiFID II prohibits broker crossing networks and requires firms to set up systematic internalisers in order to commit capital. More than 100 SIs have registered in fixed income which has led to increased fragmentation and complexity as investors need to navigate more venues and trading protocols. AxeTrader provides banks, broker-dealers and buy-side firms with an aggregated view of of fixed income liquidity including axes, runs and quotes from the electronic venues, messaging platforms and voice channels used by a client.

?More MiFID II data is beginning to emerge and clients are discussing APIs, how to use data and how to integrate data into their workflow which will feed into the best execution process,? added Watters. ?These conversations were not happening to such an extent even in January and February this year.?

As a result of the increased regulatory requirements under MiFID II, AxeTrading signed a technology partnership with BGC Partners in April this year for the broker to extend its use of AxeTrader across a number of its agency businesses.

The firm said in a statement at the time: ?The move comes as BGC Partners extends its regulatory compliance, with immediate attention to the cross-asset best-execution requirements of its agency brokerage businesses under MiFID II, which came into effect on 3 January 2018.?

Last year AxeTrading received a strategic investment of ?2m ($2.4m)  from Illuminate Financial Management, the venture capital firm which funds fintech companies in capital markets that create change through providing solutions for cost, control, capital efficiency or compliance with regulations.

Fragmentation

Consultancy Aite Group said in a report, Best Execution, Fragmentation, and Data: Fixed Income?s Cerberus, that the fragmentation of fixed income liquidity has reached an all-time high with the proliferation of electronic venues heading to nearly 150.

Audrey Blater, Ph.D., author of the report, explained in the report that Cerberus is a three-headed dog that guards the underworld to prevent the dead from leaving.


Audrey Blater, Aite Group

?While no such beast exists in reality, best execution, fragmentation, and data have become three pain points in today?s bond markets that prevent full transparency ? the Cerberus of fixed income,? she added. ?While best execution practices are required by regulators, collecting, cleaning, and aggregating supportive data can be incredibly challenging for illiquid securities.?

She cited Bill De Leon, managing director and global head of portfolio risk management at asset manager Pimco, who spoke at the Fixed Income Leaders Summit in Boston in June. De Leon said that global firms need to normalize various types of data across multiple platforms to achieve best execution.

?He points to the presence of data accessibility, such as granular tick data, for the analysis of US Treasuries and futures but asserts that beyond these instruments, fixed income data is sparse and difficult,? she wrote. ?Thus, managing information and data becomes a big problem ? firms have many products and many people executing, and have to be sure that what?s being done is meaningful.?

Blater continued that the MiFID II measure of liquid bonds has fallen short of expectations and Trace, the US reporting system for bond trading,  remains a good but imperfect vessel. Therefore, the sellside is being asked to step in and provide clients with superior market and evaluative data.

?This will foster the transaction cost analysis and data provider arms race?which is only won by offering cutting-edge technology, seamless integration, and custom client solutions,? Blater added.

Investment Co. Slams Schwab With $100M Defamation Suit,https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/1070282/investment-co-slams-schwab-with-100m-defamation-suit,https://www.law360.com/,Yes,Liquidity,"Law360 (August 6, 2018, 3:28 PM EDT) -- A Texas investment adviser hit Charles Schwab Corp. with a $100 million defamation suit, claiming the national investment firm poached its clients after terminating their working relationship because of false stories alleging the adviser colluded with President Donald Trump, Russians and Fox News to publish ?fake news.?

Chapwood Capital Investment Management LLC told the Eastern District of Texas Friday that Charles Schwab terminated an ?excellent? business relationship that had been in place since 2008 after NPR published a story accusing Chapwood founder Ed Butowsky of working with Fox News, Russian agents and the White House to ?concoct? a story alleging that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich had leaked emails to WikiLeaks in 2016 and was murdered over it.

 After the story was published in August 2017, Chapwood claims Charles Schwab started contacting Chapwood?s current and former clients, telling them it planned to end its relationship with Chapwood. The emails and letters did not state Schwab?s reasoning, leaving the implication that the NPR story was true and Chapwood was no longer trustworthy because of it, Chapwood said.

?In letters baked full of half-truths and insinuations of malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance, Schwab painted Chapwood and its principals as unethical, dishonest and untrustworthy,? Chapwood said. ?The insinuation and implication was clear ? there was a real problem, an immediate danger, and clients and former clients needed to be constantly warned about Chapwood.?

Chapwood claims it lost nearly 270 accounts and $45 million in assets under management as a result of Charles Schwab?s actions.

 Shortly after the article was published, Charles Schwab contacted Chapwood to request a conference call to discuss Butowsky?s ?political views and Trump,? but the call never happened. Instead, the email writing-campaign started, and Chapwood did not learn about the impending termination of the business relationship until after emails had been sent to its clients, according to the complaint.

 Chapwood claims Charles Schwab knew the story was false, but secretly planned to use the story as a way to defame Chapwood and poach its clients.

?The suggestion that the President of the United States and the ?Russians? (Vladimir Putin) would have colluded with Butowsky ? a person unknown to either the president or Putin and with whom neither the president nor Putin has ever communicated ? was preposterous,? Chapwood said.

 The emails, which Chapwood said were sent in violation of the agreement between the firms, did not include Schwab?s political reasoning for terminating the relationship, leaving through omission the implication that the NPR story was true, according to the complaint.

?The letters were carefully written and crafted to deceive Chapwood?s clients and to cause them to question Chapwood and Butowsky?s honesty and integrity,? Chapwood said.

 In the nearly 10 years the companies worked together, the relationship was ?excellent? and there had been no customer complaints, Chapwood claimed, making it clear that the reason for terminating the agreement was the false narrative about Butowsky?s alleged collusion.

 In addition to losing clients and assets, Chapwood went through the ?painful? process of finding another broker-dealer and custodian for client assets, as the unexplained termination ?caused endless embarrassing and unanswerable questions,? with many companies rejecting Chapwood, according to the complaint.

?The defendants? acts and omissions cast aspersion on Chapwood and Butowsky?s honesty, credit, efficiency, prestige and standing in the investment advisory business,? Chapwood said. ?Chapwood and Butowsky endured insult, humiliation, embarrassment and injury to their names and reputations because of the defendants? letters and published statements.?

A spokesperson for Charles Schwab said in an email that the company terminated its relationship with Chapwood on Jan. 22 under the terms of its agreement with the firm, and the termination came after a thorough business review. The spokesperson added the company does not publicly discuss details of its business reviews.

 Representatives for Chapwood could not immediately be reached for comment Monday morning.

 Chapwood and Butowsky are represented by Steven S. Biss of Law Office of Steven S. Biss and Ty Clevenger, Esq. of Ty Odell Clevenger, Attorney At Law.

 Counsel information for Charles Schwab was not available.

 The case is Chapwood Capital Investment Management, LLC et al. v. Charles Schwab Corporation et al., case number 4:18-cv-00548, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

Summary


?Fidelity finally sets the bar at zero.

?Indexing - The Death Star.

?Wealth Management vs. Money Management - a Key Difference.


Fidelity Investments has finally done it. The large Boston-based fund manager recently cut the management fees on two of their index-oriented stock mutual funds to zero - nada - NOTHING. Their arch-rival Vanguard Group pioneered cheap, index-based investing in 1974. Forty-four years later, after decades of competitive innovation, fee-cutting and marketing hocus between Fidelity, Vanguard, and third rival Charles Schwab, we've reached a crossroads in the industry. Money management is officially a free service! How can Fidelity (or anyone) make money at zero? Could fees actually go below zero in the future? Where is the ""value add"" in the investment industry today? What about so-called ""wealth managers""? What's their place in the industry? With this latest news from Fidelity, these are a few of the key questions facing providers and clients alike. We've got a few tentative answers.

First, on the matter of whether money managers can be profitable without charging fees, the answer is? it depends. Large players (like the Big Three mentioned above) can generally make it work because of two things - scale economies and securities lending. Schwab and Fidelity, for example, have custody of trillions of dollars in stocks and bonds. They can lend your Boeing or Exxon shares to short-sellers in return for fees. Likewise, Vanguard can sell and later repurchase your Treasury bonds from a hedge fund in return for interest payments. In this way (and others), large securities portfolios (portfolios technically ""owned"" by customers) generate material levels of income - enough to cover the cost of running an index fund, for example.

Remember, in money management as in most personal service businesses, costs are mostly people costs. Substituting a rote equity index and a computer program for the (well paid) people formerly managing the money can generate big savings. This is one of the secrets of the Big Three, and they're making it work - for themselves and millions of retail investors. In the future, the benefits of automation will continue to flow, and as competition between the big players continues to heat up, there's no practical reason that fees can't go negative, at least for short periods. Imagine being paid by your money manager for the privilege of handing him your nest egg! Cry no tears for your Big Three custodian, however; they're making it up on the securities lending

"Asian stocks trim gains as China, Japan swing to red, trade fears weigh",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/asian-stocks-trim-gains-as-china-japan-swing-to-red-trade-fears-weigh-20180806-00056,https://www.nasdaq.com/,Yes,Market,"SYDNEY, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares pared gains on Monday as Chinese stocks swung into negative territory, dragged lower by the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, though Beijing's efforts to stop sharp declines in the yuan helped support the currency.

Spreadbetters pointed to a tentative start for European shares with futures for London's FTSE up 0.07 percent. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were up 0.08 percent. 





Chinese shares turned negative with the blue-chip share index and Shanghai's SSE Composite down more than 1 percent each. Japan's Nikkei and South Korea's Kospi index slipped 0.1 percent.

Among the gainers, Australian shares added 0.6 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.5 percent.

The trade dispute remains a live issue for markets with China proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict. 

That was followed by a report in China's state media saying Friday's retaliatory tariffs were ""rational"" while accusing the United States of blackmail. 

At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is ""working far better than anyone ever anticipated"", citing losses in China's stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could ""go up dramatically"" once trade deals were renegotiated. 

""The drip feed of escalating tariff threats from Trump and counter threats from China continues,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.

""With a 25 percent tariff on...(some) Chinese imports likely to commence soon, Trump is clearly ramping up the pressure on China but China is digging in,"" Oliver added.

""A tariff of this magnitude will start to have a significant economic impact on China's growth, potentially knocking up to 0.5 percent off growth, and probably also on the U.S.""

At the same time, China is stepping up measures to support its currency, which has been hit by the worsening trade skirmish.

Late on Friday, the People's Bank of China raised the reserve requirement on some foreign exchange forward positions, making it more expensive to bet against the Chinese currency and helping pull the yuan away from 14-month lows. 

The move boosted the Australian dollar, which is often played as a liquid proxy for the yuan. The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7386.

""Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilising domestic asset prices,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a note.

""Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.""

Wall Street indices gained on Friday, helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions.

According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year.

While the risk of a trade war was the main worry for investors, other factors were weighing on sentiment too.

""Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth,"" said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, has risen 3.4 percent so far this year with strong rallies since April when Trump first announced the tariffs. The index was last up 0.2 percent at 95.32.

Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. 

The British pound hovered near 11-day lows at $1.287 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an ""uncomfortably high"" risk of a ""no deal"" Brexit. 

The euro inched down to more than 5-week lows of $1.155.

Gold bounced from near 17-month lows after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, and was last at $1,212.53. 

Meanwhile, Brent crude futures rose 10 cents to $73.31, while U.S. crude oil futures added 16 cents to $68.66 a barrel.

"Exonerated in defamation suits, Ed Butowsky is out for blood",http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20180806/FREE/180809955/exonerated-in-defamation-suits-ed-butowsky-is-out-for-blood,http://www.investmentnews.com/,Yes,Liquidity,"The dismissal last week of two lawsuits against Plano, Texas-based financial adviser Ed Butowsky has not yet taken the form of a warm and fuzzy feeling.





""Anybody who did anything negative to me as a result of the lawsuit will pay,"" Mr. Butowsky said Monday. ""I'm going to sue the hell out of a lot of firms. I want to see these people choke on their nerves and go through the same crap I had to go through.""

Last August, Mr. Butowsky, managing director of Chapwood Investments, was named in two high-profile lawsuits related to a since-retracted Fox News story about murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. The two lawsuits also named Fox News and a Fox News reporter, Malia Zimmerman. One suit was brought by Mr. Rich's parents and the other by Rod Wheeler, an investigator looking into Mr. Rich's death for his parents.

The defamation lawsuits were dismissed Thursday by U.S. District Judge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York, who cited a failure to prove statements were false or a basis for the defamation claims.

Mr. Butowsky isn't yet ready to move past the publicized allegations that he conspired with Fox News and ""worked in concert under the watchful eye of the White House to concoct a story about the death of a young DNC aide.""

""The story around this case had everything to do with the lawyer who filed the lawsuit,"" said Mr. Butowsky, referring to Doug Wigdor of the New York law firm of Wigdor, who represented Mr. Wheeler. 





""Lawyers can put anything they want in a lawsuit; there's so much flexibility, it's hideous,"" Mr. Butowsky said. ""For a year I've been known as the guy who is Trump's backer, and as someone who loves Trump and made up stories to divert attention from what really happened.""

The Wigdor law firm refused to comment on the dismissal, but pointed out that it had stopped representing Mr. Wheeler on May 30. Eli J. Kay-Oliphant, an attorney at Massey & Gail who represents the Riches, did not return a call for comment.

Mr. Butowsky said he still stands by the retracted Fox News story.

""I didn't see anything wrong with [Malia Zimmerman's] article,"" he said. ""Despite the claims, Rod Wheeler was not misquoted. The story is that Wigdor made up stuff related to Malia's story.""

Mr. Butowsky said his financial planning business was negatively affected by the news reports about the lawsuit.





""We lost about a third of our business last year related to a made-up story by a greedy lawyer,"" he said. ""I lost a lot of clients on day one. Some wouldn't even pick up the phone, and the ones that did wouldn't listen to my side of the story. And the clients that stayed with me are still skeptical.""

In April, Mr. Butowsky filed a $100 million lawsuit against Charles Schwab Corp. after the custodian terminated its 12-year relationship with Chapwood, without cause, according to the lawsuit.

That lawsuit, which Mr. Butowsky said he is still pursuing, claims Schwab's ""intentional wrongdoing"" caused Chapwood's assets under management to decline by $45 million to less than $200 million.

The suit also claims that after being kicked off of the custodian platform, Chapwood lost ""over 268 customer accounts and suffered substantial loss of income.""

A Schwab spokeswoman, Mayura Hooper, wrote in an email that ""Schwab has terminated its relationship with Chapwood Capital Investment under the terms of our contractual agreement, effective January 22, 2018."" 

""The termination was a business decision following a thorough business review of Chapwood,"" Ms. Hooper said. ""We do not publicly discuss the details of our business reviews.""

In addition to his plans for a string of lawsuits, Mr. Butowsky is preparing to go after any financial advisers who took advantage of the situation by poaching his clients.

""To those financial advisers that went after my clients, I know who they are, and I'm going to go after them and my clients,"" he said. 

Mr. Butowsky said that in addition to the damage to his business and reputation, the defamation lawsuits took a toll on his personal life.

""I had death threats, and vandalism to my home and car,"" he said. ""There was even a death clock on the internet counting down the days till my 20-year-old son got back to Vanderbilt, so somebody could kill him.""

Portsmouth Takes Next Steps to Become a Smart City,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/portsmouth-takes-next-steps-to-become-a-smart-city-1027439622,https://markets.businessinsider.com/,No,Market,"PORTSMOUTH, Va., Aug. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Portsmouth City Council is taking the next steps to make the historic port city a smart city. Earlier this year, the city implemented a fiber design master plan, and an RFP (Request for Proposal) was issued to construct a community broadband network. The broadband project encompasses 55 miles of state-of-the-art fiber optics designed to increase internet connectivity around the city. City leadership has now re-engaged Federal Engineering Inc. (FE) and its subcontractor Magellan Advisors (FE/Magellan Team), the nation's leading broadband and smart city development firm, to create a Citizen Connectivity Study. The study will be focused on using the City's planned fiber-optic backbone network:
?* as a platform for digital inclusion initiatives
?* a driver for economic development
?* for support of efficient municipal operations, and
?* to increase the area's quality of life
?Through the proposed Citizen Connectivity Study, the consultants will survey households and businesses to understand how they currently use technology and the importance of high-speed digital connectivity. Survey results will reveal the benefits of and barriers to technology use, particularly available internet access options. Working with City departmental leaders, the FE/Magellan Team will engage key stakeholders, from major businesses to neighborhood champions, to define current gaps and goals. A series of workshops will be conducted to gather input and learn about connectivity needs and opportunities. The insights and anecdotal evidence from these discussions will allow for deep insights into what connectivity means for Portsmouth's citizenry in today's global digital economy.

The FE/Magellan Team will supplement its extensive knowledge from designing Portsmouth's new fiber-optic network with research into other regional network infrastructure. The area has numerous large entities that own infrastructure, in part because it is a major pass-through area for the east coast and termination points for undersea cables. Network service providers are invited to share connectivity issues they have encountered and how they might help address community needs.

?Portsmouth's community broadband network will include connections to community anchor institutions such as hospitals, higher education centers, and will serve as a catalyst to narrow the digital divide and regional broadband initiatives. Construction began in July. Daniel Jones, chief information officer for the city of Portsmouth said the project is a five-year build-out that will make Portsmouth a digital port. The community broadband network is a $9 million multiphase capital project.
?""The Citizen Connectivity Study will provide precise information on what businesses and citizens actually need when it comes to high-speed internet connectivity,"" said Jones. ""Our project will connect all municipal facilities including schools and the broadband network will improve municipal operations at a substantial cost savings.""
?The study will be conducted in conjunction with a new Smart City study group being established by the City. The consultant will engage with the community through this group, as well as local associations, civic leagues, and businesses. Results from the surveys, discussions, and infrastructure inventory will be analyzed along with input from these groups to establish a strategy and action plan for the City. The connectivity study is expected to be completed over the next five months.

Book value per share and adjusted book value per share both increased 1% in the second quarter of 2018.  Book value per share decreased 1% and adjusted book value per share was near break-even in the first six months of 2018, including dividends.

Manning Rountree, CEO, commented, ""We had decent results in the quarter, with ABVPS up 1%.  After a slow start to the year, BAM's results rebounded in the second quarter, with higher par insured volumes and good pricing.  MediaAlpha maintained its momentum, with strong top and bottom line growth.  Our investment portfolio produced a total return of 0.7%, driven largely by the rebound in equity markets.

HG Global/BAM

BAM insured municipal bonds with par value of $3.1 billion and $4.4 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $2.7 billion and $5.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  Gross written premiums and member surplus contributions totaled $29 million and $40 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $20 million and $48 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  Total pricing, which is gross written premiums and MSC adjusted to include the present value of future installment MSC not yet collected and to exclude the impact of gross written premium adjustments on existing policies, weighted by the par value of municipal bonds insured, was 101 and 100 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to 79 and 98 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  BAM's total claims paying resources were $827 million at June 30, 2018, compared to $708 million at December 31, 2017 and $676 million at June 30, 2017.  The increase in claims paying resources was primarily driven by the $100 million reinsurance agreement with Fidus Re completed in the second quarter of 2018.

Sen McCarthy, CEO of BAM, said, ""In the second quarter, new-issue municipal bond volume recovered, and longer-term new-money transactions represented a larger share of the total market volume. These favorable trends allowed BAM to more than double its primary and secondary market volume, quarter over quarter, while maintaining attractive risk-adjusted pricing levels.  Claims-paying resources finished the quarter at an all-time high, reflecting the close of the Fidus Re transaction, which added $100 million of reinsurance protection in the form of collateralized insurance-linked securities.  On June 25th, S&P Global Ratings affirmed BAM's AA/Stable rating, citing BAM's market acceptance, proven track record of credit discipline and growth in par insured and premiums written.""

HG Global reported pre-tax income of $8 million and $12 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax income of $7 million and $13 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  White Mountains reported pre-tax loss related to BAM of $17 million and $36 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax loss of $12 million and $24 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The changes at BAM were driven primarily by lower investment returns in 2018.

BAM is a mutual insurance company that is owned by its members.  BAM's results are consolidated into White Mountains's GAAP financial statements and attributed to non-controlling interests.

NSM

On May 11, 2018, White Mountains acquired 95% of NSM Insurance HoldCo, LLC (""NSM""), an insurance program administrator.  White Mountains paid $274 million of cash consideration for its equity interest in NSM.

Subsequently, on May 18, 2018, NSM acquired 100% of Fresh Insurance Services Group Limited (""Fresh Insurance""), an insurance broker that specializes in non-standard personal lines, motor trade, van, and travel insurance in the United Kingdom.  NSM paid GBP 37 million (approximately $50 million based on the spot rate at the date of acquisition) of upfront cash consideration for its equity interest in Fresh Insurance.

NSM reported revenues of $24 million and pre-tax income of $3 million for the period from May 11, 2018 through June 30, 2018.

Geof McKernan, CEO of NSM Insurance Group, said, ""We are excited to partner with White Mountains, whose insurance expertise and patient approach to value creation are a natural fit with NSM.  We've hit the ground running, closing the Fresh acquisition only one week after joining White Mountains.  With Fresh, we've added a strong operation with non-standard personal lines expertise that will complement Vantage Insurance Group, our UK specialist insurance agency.  More broadly, our business is performing well across most lines, in the US and the UK, producing modest top and bottom line growth during the quarter.""

MediaAlpha

MediaAlpha reported pre-tax income of $5 million and $4 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax loss of $2 million and $3 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  MediaAlpha's adjusted EBITDA was $8 million and $17 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $1 million and $3 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  MediaAlpha reported revenues of $72 million and $144 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $31 million and $63 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The increases in pre-tax income, adjusted EBITDA and revenues for both periods were primarily driven by growth in the P&C vertical and the Health, Medicare and Life vertical, which includes the impact of the acquisition of assets from Healthplans.com in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Cost of sales was $60 million and $117 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $26 million and $54 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by transaction volume growth.  General and administrative expenses were $5 million and $16 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $4 million and $7 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The increase for the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 was primarily driven by the recognition of non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $7 million in the first six months of 2018.

Other Operations

White Mountains's Other Operations segment reported pre-tax loss of $11 million and $62 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax income of $4 million and $7 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The changes were driven primarily by lower investment returns in 2018, partially offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses.  Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) were $13 million and $(33) million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to net realized and unrealized gains of $33 million and $68 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  Net investment income was $8 million and $24 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $12 million and $22 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  General and administrative expenses were $31 million and $53 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $41 million and $86 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, which included higher incentive compensation costs.

Share Repurchases

During the second quarter of 2018, White Mountains repurchased and retired 575,068 of its common shares for $505 million at an average price per share of $878, or approximately 96% of White Mountains's June 30, 2018 adjusted book value per share.  For the first six months of 2018, White Mountains repurchased and retired 585,033 of its common shares for $513 million at an average share price of $877, or approximately 96% of White Mountains's June 30, 2018 adjusted book value per share.  This activity left White Mountains with $1.3 billion of undeployed capital as of June 30, 2018.

Investments

The total return on invested assets was 0.7% in the second quarter of 2018 and -0.3% in the first six months of 2018, compared to returns of 1.4% in the second quarter of 2017 and 2.9% in the first six months of 2017.

Mark Plourde, Managing Director of White Mountains Advisors, said, ""The total portfolio was up 0.7% in the quarter, a decent result.  The fixed income portfolio returned 0.3%, outperforming the BBIA Index.  Common stocks and ETFs returned 2.1%, lagging the S&P 500 Index, primarily due to underperformance in our international common stock positions.""

Douglas Dynamics Announces Second Quarter 2018 Results,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/douglas-dynamics-announces-second-quarter-2018-results-1027435647,https://markets.businessinsider.com/,No,Market,"Second Quarter Highlights:
?Produced record quarterly Net sales of $163.4 million, a 17% increase over 2Q17
?Delivered record second quarter Net income of $21.2 million, or $0.91 per diluted share
?Paid $0.265 per share cash dividend 
?Company narrows Full-Year 2018 outlook 
?Record results driven by strong pre-season sales of commercial snow and ice control products and a return to average snow levels
?Chassis supply issues continue to impact sales of Municipal products

MILWAUKEE, Aug. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Douglas Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE: PLOW), North America?s premier manufacturer and upfitter of work truck attachments and equipment, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018.

James L. Janik, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, ?Our record results this quarter reflect a strong start to the pre-season for our commercial snow and ice control products, which met our internal expectations. We continue to manage through the industry wide chassis availability issues, which impacted sales of our municipal products. As we proceed into the second half of the year, we are pleased with the performance of the overall business but are aware that the chassis supply issues will continue to hinder our performance in the coming quarters. We are focused on optimizing the factors that are within our control and continuing to drive improvements across both segments through ongoing DDMS initiatives.?

Consolidated Second Quarter 2018 Results

Net sales were a quarterly-record $163.4 million, an increase of 17% when compared to second quarter 2017 net sales of $139.4 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the robust performance of the Work Truck Attachments segment during the quarter, combined with solid performance of the Work Truck Solutions segment.

Gross profit was a quarterly-record $55.8 million, or 34.2% of net sales, compared to $45.0 million, or 32.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017. The increase is similarly attributable to the strong performance by the Work Truck Attachments segment during the quarter.  Additionally, gross profit as a percentage of sales increased for the second quarter of 2018 due to higher volumes at both Work Truck Attachments and Work Truck Solutions.

The Company?s effective tax rate was 24.6% and 34.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was lower than the corresponding period in 2017 due to the lower corporate tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that went into effect December 22, 2017.

Net income for the second quarter of 2018 was a second quarter-record $21.2 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017.

Adjusted net income was a quarterly-record $23.5 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $14.9 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2017.

The Company reported quarterly-record Adjusted EBITDA of $40.1 million, a significant increase when compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $31.3 million in the second quarter of 2017.

Work Truck Attachments Second Quarter 2018 Results

Work Truck Attachments segment recorded revenue of $127.3 million, resulting in income from operations of $38.8 million, compared to $105.5 million in revenue and $27.1 million in income from operations in the second quarter of 2017. Both data points met initial internal expectations, given the snowfall for the period. Snowfall in the markets served by the Company during the snow season ended March 31, 2018 was near historical averages, while the snow season ending March 31, 2017 saw below average levels.

The Company?s commercial snow and ice management products include a pre-season ordering period that extends across the second and third quarters. For the past two years, pre-season sales were more heavily weighted towards the second quarter versus the third quarter in an approximate 55%-45% split, which is in line with historical trends and averages. However, for 2018, the Company anticipates an approximate 60%-40% split of preseason ordering between the second and third quarters.

Janik explained, ?The pre-season performance for our commercial snow and ice management products has been right on schedule, benefitting from the average snowfall levels across the country this past winter, plus a positive response to the new products we launched earlier this year. External factors such as the economy and truck sales also continue to be in our favor and we anticipate a larger proportion of pre-season sales occurring in the second quarter rather than the third quarter this year. While we do expect chassis supply issues for our municipal products in the second half of the year, the good news is that demand and backlog for our municipal products and services has never been greater, and our teams are doing all they can to deliver for their customers.?

Work Truck Solutions Second Quarter 2018 Results

Work Truck Solutions segment produced revenue of $37.1 million and $0.5 million in income from operations, compared to $34.9 million in revenue and $2.5 million in income from operations in the second quarter of 2017.  The increase in revenue relates primarily to generally improved demand dynamics compared to the same period last year, and the ongoing ramp up in additional facilities that opened in 2017. The profitability of the Work Truck Solutions segment was impacted by the continuing ramp of new facilities, higher variable compensation and benefit expense, and unusual legal expenses related to defending our intellectual property.

?We produced a solid quarter in Solutions and saw strong demand patterns as we continue to make the necessary investments in the business to produce sustainable long-term growth,? noted Janik.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity

During the first six months of 2018, the Company recorded net cash provided by operating activities of $11.0 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $13.3 million in the same period last year.

Inventory was $84.6 million compared to $85.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Accounts receivable were $95.0 million compared to $80.1 million at the end of the second quarter 2017. The decrease in inventory and increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from the corresponding increase in sales.

Dividend 

As previously reported, on June 7, 2018 the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.265 per share of the Company's common stock. The dividend was paid on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 19, 2018.

Outlook

Based on recent results, the overall economic climate, dealer sentiment, and industry trends, the Company is narrowing its 2018 financial outlook as follows:
?Net sales are now expected to be between $490 million and $535 million.
?Adjusted EBITDA is now predicted to range from $90 million to $110 million.
?Adjusted Earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $1.75 per share to $2.05 per share.

It is important to note that the Company?s outlook assumes that the economy will remain stable and that the Company?s core markets will experience average snowfall levels in the fourth quarter.

Mr. Janik added, ?As usual, we have narrowed our outlook ranges now that we have more visibility and are pleased with our projections for the year. The shift in the revenue range also reflects pricing changes we are implementing in light of impending inflation of components and raw materials. While we are certainly proud of the Company?s accomplishments this quarter, it is important to remember that we do expect the third quarter to be less robust by comparison, as some pre-season sales we would typically expect to occur in the third quarter were pulled ahead into the second quarter, plus the negative impact of the chassis supply issues impacting the industry. As we?ve regularly said, we will execute our strategy to continue to deliver shareholder value over the long-term.?

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (?GAAP?).  The non-GAAP measure used in this press release is Adjusted EBITDA.

These non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for stock-based compensation, litigation proceeds, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and certain charges related to certain unrelated legal fees and consulting fees.  The Company uses, and believes its investors benefit from the presentation of, Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the Company?s operating performance because Adjusted EBITDA provides the Company and its investors with additional tools to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company?s core operations. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of its consolidated financial statements in evaluating the Company?s operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company?s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. The Company?s management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and financial projections, and to evaluate the Company?s ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with its senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of ?Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA? that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.

Consistent with Regulation G under the U.S. federal securities laws, the non-GAAP measure in this press release has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure, and this reconciliation is located under the heading ""Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation"" following the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this press release.

With respect to the Company?s 2018 guidance, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP because it does not provide specific guidance for the various extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual charges and other certain items. These items have not yet occurred, are out of the Company?s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. As a result, reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance measures to GAAP is not available without unreasonable effort and the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

Forward Looking Statements 

This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation, product demand, the payment of dividends, and availability of financial resources.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, particularly lack of or reduced levels of snowfall and the timing of such snowfall, a significant decline in economic conditions, our inability to maintain good relationships with the original equipment manufacturers with whom we currently do significant business, lack of available or favorable financing options for our end-users or distributors, increases in the price of steel or other materials (including as a result of tariffs) necessary for the production of our products that cannot be passed on to our distributors, increases in the price of fuel, the inability of our suppliers and original equipment manufacturer partners to meet our volume or quality requirements, inaccuracies in our estimates of future demand for our products, our inability to protect or continue to build our intellectual property portfolio, the effects of laws and regulations and their interpretations on our business and financial condition, our inability to develop new products or improve upon existing products in response to end-user needs, losses due to lawsuits arising out of personal injuries associated with our products, factors that could impact the future declaration and payment of dividends, our inability to compete effectively against competition, our inability to achieve the projected financial performance with the business of Henderson Enterprises Group, Inc., which we acquired in 2014, the assets of Dejana Truck & Utility Equipment Company, Inc., which we acquired in 2016, or the assets of Arrowhead Equipment, Inc., which we acquired in 2017, and unexpected costs or liabilities related to such acquisitions, as well as those discussed in the section entitled ?Risk Factors? in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Mueller Water Products Reports 2018 Third Quarter Results,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mueller-water-products-reports-2018-third-quarter-results-1027435572,https://markets.businessinsider.com,No,Market,"Increased Net Sales 7.8%

Earned Net Income per Diluted Share of $0.10

Delivered Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share of $0.19

ATLANTA, Aug. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mueller Water Products, Inc. (NYSE:MWA) announced today that for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended June 30, 2018 net sales were $250.2 million and net income was $15.3 million.

In the 2018 third quarter, the Company:
?Increased net sales 7.8 percent, or $18.0 million, to $250.2 million as compared with $232.2 million in the prior year quarter.
?Generated operating income of $30.6 million and adjusted operating income of $47.3 million as compared with $43.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively, in the prior year quarter.
?Reported income from continuing operations of $15.3 million as compared with $24.1 million in the prior year quarter.  Improved adjusted net income to $30.0 million as compared with $25.4 million in the prior year quarter.
?Recorded a $14.1 million warranty charge at Technologies, a $6.2 million charge related to debt refinancing, a $2.4 million settlement gain on termination of interest rate swap contracts and other charges of $2.6 million.
?Reported net income per diluted share of $0.10 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.19 as compared with net income per diluted share of $0.15 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.16 in the prior year quarter.
?Generated $43.2 million of free cash flow through the first nine months as compared with $3.8 million in the prior year period.
?Refinanced outstanding debt with $450 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2026 and decreased outstanding debt by $33.9 million.

?With net sales growth of 7.8 percent in the quarter, we continue to be very encouraged by the healthy demand in both municipal and residential end markets.  Infrastructure and Technologies each generated solid volume growth in the quarter.  In addition, we are benefiting from the price increases we implemented in the second quarter, which more than covered inflation.  We also increased our adjusted operating income and adjusted net income per share.  However, conversion margin lagged in the quarter primarily due to higher costs associated with inflation, some unexpected equipment downtime and repairs, and timing of certain SG&A expenses,? said Scott Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mueller Water Products.

?We continue to make solid progress on our key initiatives to execute our go-to-market strategies as a customer-focused organization, drive operational excellence and accelerate new product development.  Our new product development initiatives are gaining momentum.  At the American Water Works Association Annual Conference, we introduced a smart fire hydrant that monitors pressure and detects leaks, and at Singapore International Water Week, we showcased the deployment of our EchoShore? TX leak detection monitoring system being used by PUB, Singapore?s National Water Agency.

?We anticipate continued growth in our end markets in 2018.  For full year 2018, we expect our consolidated net sales increase to be at the high end of the 7 to 9 percent range we provided last quarter, with adjusted operating income growing between 9 and 11 percent.

?I am excited about where we are with our strategic initiatives and the contribution they should provide to our performance going forward.  Our growth strategies are supported by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow with a capital allocation strategy focused on enhancing our position as a leading water infrastructure company.?

Consolidated Results

Net sales for the 2018 third quarter increased $18.0 million, or 7.8 percent, to $250.2 million as compared with $232.2 million in the 2017 third quarter with growth in both segments.

Adjusted operating income increased to $47.3 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $45.0 million in the 2017 third quarter.

Segment Results

Infrastructure

Net sales for the 2018 third quarter increased $16.5 million, or 7.9 percent, to $224.1 million as compared with $207.6 million in the 2017 third quarter, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and higher pricing.

Operating income was $57.0 million in the quarter.  Adjusted operating income for the 2018 third quarter increased 5.2 percent to $57.0 million as compared with $54.2 million in the 2017 third quarter.  Adjusted operating income increased primarily due to higher pricing and higher shipment volumes, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with inflation, unexpected equipment downtime and repairs, and timing of certain SG&A expenses.

Technologies

Net sales for the 2018 third quarter increased $1.5 million, or 6.1 percent, to $26.1 million, as compared with $24.6 million in the 2017 third quarter, due to higher volumes.

During the quarter, we completed a new study of our historical warranty experience.  As a result of this new information, we recorded a warranty charge of $14.1 million during the quarter.

Operating loss was $16.1 million in the 2018 third quarter, which includes the $14.1 million warranty charge mentioned above, and was $1.6 million in the prior year quarter.  Adjusted operating loss was $2.0 million in the 2018 third quarter and was $1.6 million in the 2017 third quarter.  Adjusted operating loss increased primarily due to increased costs associated with unexpected equipment downtime and repairs and inflation, partially offset by higher volumes.

Interest Expense, Net and Related Items

Interest expense, net for the 2018 third quarter was $5.3 million as compared with $5.1 million in the 2017 third quarter.  During the third quarter, we issued $450 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due in 2026.  We repaid our outstanding term loan with proceeds from the offering and cash on hand.  We wrote-off the deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount associated with the term loan, resulting in a one-time non-cash charge of $6.2 million.  In addition, we terminated our interest swap contracts and recorded a one-time $2.4 million cash gain.

Income Taxes

For the 2018 third quarter, the Company reported income tax expense of $6.0 million, or 28.2 percent of income before income taxes.  This rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, manufacturing deductions and discrete items.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company?s results as determined under GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP information that management believes is useful to investors.  These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and securities analysts, investors and other interested parties should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company?s results as reported under GAAP.  These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The Company presents adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as performance measures because management uses these measures in evaluating the Company?s underlying performance on a consistent basis across periods and in making decisions about operational strategies.  Management also believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company?s recurring performance.

The Company presents net debt and net debt leverage as performance measures because management uses them in evaluating its capital management, and the investment community commonly uses them as measures of indebtedness.  The Company presents free cash flow because management believes it is commonly used by the investment community to measure the Company?s ability to create liquidity.

The calculations of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to GAAP results are included as an attachment to this press release and have been posted online at www.muellerwaterproducts.com.

Forward-Looking Statements

All statements that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, plan, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our go-to-market strategies, operational excellence, acceleration of new product development, continued growth in our end markets in this fiscal year, net sales growth and adjusted operating income targets, growth and capital allocation strategies and future warranty charges.  Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and assessments made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments.

?Safety First? Rules Bond ETFs as Cautious Tone Directs Flows,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/etf-fund-flows/,https://www.bloomberg.com/,Yes,Market,"
Investors in bond ETFs turned more cautious in August as a selloff roiled emerging markets and the Federal Reserve said it would continue raising interest rates in the U.S.

Flows into exchange-traded funds that buy corporate debt moderated, with inflows into ETFs that own investment-grade securities slumping to $4.6 billion, the lowest since February. Appetite for junk bonds also faded. Instead, government bonds?widely regarded as the safest asset class?were back in style, receiving $2.5 billion after posting their most disappointing month of the year in July.

ETFs holding bonds that come due in one-to-three years absorbed a similar amount, which was the most since May and almost double the flow into intermediate- and long-term bonds combined. However, interest in ultra short-term bonds slipped as funds owning debt with less than a year to maturity gained just $1.2 billion, the least since January.

Bank loan-focused funds were the only ETFs to lose assets in August, surrendering about $340 million.

Dan Ivascyn Goes ?Defensive? With $114 Billion Pimco Income Fund,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/dan-ivascyn-goes-defensive-with-114-billion-pimco-income-fund,https://www.bloomberg.com/,No,Market,"Daniel Ivascyn says it?s time to take a more ?cautious and defensive? strategy with the $113.7 billion Pimco Income Fund.



The chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. said he?s taking the tack as central banks move away from accommodating policies that have buttressed markets since the 2008 financial crisis.



?For both equity and fixed income investors, we think this means lower returns and, unfortunately, higher volatility,? Ivascyn and Alfred Murata, co-managers of the largest actively managed bond fund, said in a post Tuesday on the firm?s website. ?This combination creates a much more challenging investment environment.?





























The upshot: the fund will increase liquidity and diversification, he said. The plan includes being cautious about U.S. credit while looking for smaller opportunities in the global fixed-income universe.






Fixed-income managers have struggled to generate positive returns this year as interest rates rise, which drives down bond prices.

Pimco Income has lost 0.1 percent this year through Aug. 6. It has returned an average of 5.9 percent annually for the last five years, outperforming 99 percent of Bloomberg peers.

The fund will continue to invest in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, which have increased in supply over the last year, fueled by the introduction of about $300 billion backed by home loans that had previously been in default but are now being paid, according to Murata.

How A Personal Loan Helps Save You Money,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/08/07/personal-loan/#7b961c9327a8,https://www.forbes.com/,No,Market,"

They are the fastest growing type of loan - and they could help save you money and improve your credit score.

Here's what you need to know about personal loans and how they can benefit you.

What Is A Personal Loan?

A personal loan is an unsecured loan typically from $1,000 - $100,000 typically with a fixed interest rate that can be used to consolidate debt or make a large purchase. The term ""unsecured"" means you don't have to put up any collateral.



Depending on your credit profile, you may be able to qualify for a low-interest rate personal loan and save money compared to a credit card. Interest rates on personal loans are often much lower than the interest rates on credit cards, which typically range from 10-20% (or higher).

The interest rate on your personal loan will depend on several factors, which may include your credit score, credit history, monthly cash flow and debt-to-income ratio.

The stronger your credit profile and history of financial responsibility, the lower the interest rate you can expect.


When Should You Use A Personal Loan?

Personal loans are best for purchases that you plan to repay in less than five years.

Unlike student loans or mortgages that are spent on specific purchases such as education or a home, respectively, personal loans can be spent at your discretion.

Therefore, you have more flexibility and personal choice when using a personal loan.

1. Debt Consolidation and Credit Card Debt Consolidation
 


Debt consolidation is one of the most popular - and smartest - reasons to obtain a personal loan.

You can use a personal loan for debt consolidation in two primary ways:
1.Pay off existing high-interest debt (such as credit card debt) with a lower-interest personal loan
2.Combine different types of existing debt into a single personal loan to make debt repayment more organized and manageable

You can use a personal loan to consolidate high-interest credit card debt, and obtain a lower interest rate to help pay off your debt faster.

Of course, that assumes you will take advantage of the lower interest rate and lower monthly payments to accelerate your credit card pay off.

Therefore:
?DO use a personal loan to repay credit card debt and become debt-free.
?DO NOT use a personal loan as a tool to postpone debt repayment.

How A Personal Loan Can Cut Your Credit Card Interest By 50%

Here's how to cut your credit card interest rate by up to 50%:

1. Compare the interest rate on your credit card with the interest rate on the personal loan to determine which interest rate is lower.

2. If you have good or excellent credit, you should be able to obtain an interest rate lower than your current credit card interest rate.

3. If you qualify for a lower interest rate, make sure you can repay the personal loan over the loan period (such as five years, for example). Having a shorter-term loan repayment period can not only save you interest costs, but also instill discipline to retire your debt more quickly.

You can use this credit card consolidation calculator to see how much money you can save with a credit card consolidation loan.

Are There Alternatives To A Personal Loan?

There are several alternatives to a personal loan. For example, if you have good or excellent credit and plan to pay-off your existing credit card debt in 12-15 months, you could get a 0% APR credit card and make a balance transfer.

If you own your home, a home equity loan is usually a lower cost option. However, unlike a personal loan, a home equity loan is a secured loan so that means your home serves as collateral and can be claimed by the lender if you do not repay the debt.

How A Personal Loan Can Improve Your Credit Score

Can borrowing debt actually improve your credit score?

Surprisingly, yes. Here's how.

Lenders evaluate your credit card utilization, or the relationship between your credit limit and spending in a given month. If you have credit card debt and your credit utilization is too high, lenders may consider you higher risk.

Here are some ways to manage your credit card utilization:
?set up automatic balance alerts
?ask your lender to raise your credit limit (this may involve a hard credit pull so check with your lender first)
?rather than pay your balance with a single payment at the end of the month, make multiple payments throughout the month

You can also use a personal loan to help with credit utilization. For example, you may improve your credit score if you replace credit card debt with a personal loan.

Why? A personal loan is an installment loan, which means a personal loan carries a fixed repayment term. Credit cards, however, are revolving loans and have no fixed repayment term. Therefore, when you swap credit card debt for a personal loan, you can lower your credit utilization and also diversify your debt types.

2. Medical Expenses

If you have a medical emergency or unexpected medical expense and are unable to pay the full cost in cash upfront, a personal loan can be a better solution than a credit card.

Often, you can qualify for a higher loan amount with a personal loan than a credit card, which may be necessary for your health expenses.

3. Emergency Home Repair Or Home Improvement

If you need to complete an emergency home repair or a small home improvement project, and cannot take a home equity loan, access a line of credit or refinance your mortgage, then a personal loan may be an attractive option.

A personal loan can make good financial sense for a home renovation project if the renovation improves the financial value of your home (and the cost to borrow the personal loan is less than the expected appreciation of your home as a result of the renovation project).

4. Other Uses For A Personal Loan

A personal loan can used to help pay for other key life events, including an engagement ring, wedding, moving, honeymoon and many other uses.

Like any debt obligation, ask yourself whether your reason to obtain a personal loan is a ""want"" or a ""need.""

Final Thoughts: Personal Loans

Given the increase in online lending, the good news is that you can apply and receive cash from a personal loan within days.

A personal loan, however, should not be an excuse to acquire more debt. Rather, a personal loan can be a helpful tool for a smart borrower who has an action plan to get debt-free and march down the path toward financial freedom.

"Sound Off for Aug. 7: Why not add grandfather clause to AFRH tenants? rent
",https://www.sunherald.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article216221290.html,https://www.sunherald.com/,No,Market,"A different outcome? 

I think the Long Beach tax increase vote would have had a much different outcome had it been conducted similar to all other legal elections in the state rather than at the school itself. The elderly should not be forced to stand in line for hours to cast their vote, especially when you consider that they are living on a fixed income and may not be able to afford a tax increase. 

No shame 

Great article by reporter Robin Fitzgerald. Making people aware that this is a disease should facilitate more addicts and families asking for help without shame.

 




SIGN UP  
A good thing? 



I?ll give you that alcohol?s negative effects on society are harmful. So legalizing another intoxicant would be a good thing?

A better solution 

This is in reference to the rent increases at the Armed Forces Retirement Home. A more compassionate solution would be to grandfather in all existing tenants and set new rate for new tenants. We have Washington, D.C., paying lip service to those who got us here and then doing something like this.

Can?t buy class 

What a shame it is to have a so-called president hurling insults like a second grader. He has no filter. Love him or hate him there is one thing that we can all agree on. All the money in the world and all the power can?t buy you ?class.? 



Ready to help 

I think all school rooms should be equipped with a portable, quick-install, door barricade. These devices are inexpensive and extremely effective. If money is an issue I believe citizens of this county would step forward to pay for the barricades. Even though I do not have children in school and am on a fixed income, I will gladly pay for 10 portable door barricades.

Wake up everyone 

It is disgraceful that Congress can spends billions on foreign aid and illegals while our veterans have to live in fear of not being able to afford living in a military retirement home. We should storm the halls of Congress, but we are too busy looking down at our phones to care. USA, wake up.

A casino on I-10? 



We in Long Beach voted against a casino and there has been no election since. My understanding was all the casinos put money into all the schools along the Coast, not just where they were located. I also remember when the casinos said they would not compete with our restaurants, but they surely are. If a casino does at some point locate in Long Beach, I suggest it locate on Interstate 10.

GIC vs. aggregate bond ETF: Which is best for a retiree?,https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/bonds/fixed-income-investments-rising-interest-rates/,https://www.moneysense.ca/,No,Market,"Q: I am 73 years old, retired, and my portfolio is made up of short-term government bonds (40%), corporate bonds (20%), a preferred share ETF (30%), and the rest in GICs. Should I have a holding in an aggregate bond ETF at this stage, since short-term interest rates seem destined to go higher and this will affect my short-term bond portfolio?

? Dali

A: The Bank of Canada has now raised its key interest rate (called the target for the overnight rate) four times since July 2017, taking it from 0.5% to 1.5%. Many forecasters expect another hike in October. As you can attest, Dali, these rate hikes have hurt fixed-income investors, since bond prices and interest rates move like a seesaw: when one goes up, the other goes down.


READ: How rising interest rates actually affect you

But the Bank of Canada?s target is not the only interest rate that affects the fixed income market. The central bank?s rate directly affects lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, bonds with short maturities?like the ones that make up 40% of your portfolio, Dali. But in the 12 months that followed the first central bank rate increase in July 2017, the yield on 10-year Government of Canada bonds ticked up only slightly, and the yield on long-term bonds (the Bank of Canada?s benchmark has a 30-year term) actually declined. So if you held an ?aggregate? bond ETF?one that holds a mix of short, intermediate and long-term bonds?you escaped most of the damage.

Click here to see more personal finance questions answered.

Problem is, we can?t predict how interest rates will move in the future. Recently short-term yields have risen the fastest, but that may not continue. The yields on five-, 10- and 20-year bonds might soon catch up?or they might not. Trying to reposition your portfolio to profit from these moves is futile, and often counterproductive.



Dali, if you are looking for a little more stability in your income-oriented portfolio you might instead consider holding less in short-term bonds and more in GICs. The latter offer several advantages:
?Unlike bond ETFs, which move up or down with every change in interest rates, GICs don?t fluctuate in price, and many investors find this comforting.
?GICs offer significantly higher yields than government bonds of the same maturity: for example, a five-year Government of Canada bond yields about 2.2% today, compared with as much as 3.5% for a five-year GIC if you shop around.
?GICs are insured against default by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) for up to $100,000 per issuer.
?Building a GIC ladder (keeping equal amounts in GICs with terms of one, two, three, four and five years) allows you to spread out your risk so you won?t be strongly affected by modest moves in interest rates, either up or down.

The biggest downside of GICs is that you cannot sell them before maturity. But, Dali, as long as you make sure you have enough liquidity elsewhere in your portfolio, you can likely hold more in GICs than you are now. That should help ease your concerns about the possibility of rising interest rates.

SCHW stock is growing 1.31% to $50.16. When analyzing volume, determine the strength or weakness of a move. As traders, we are more interested to take part in strong moves and don?t join moves that show weakness ? or we may even watch for an entry in the opposite direction of a weak move. These guidelines do not hold true in all situations, but they are a good general aid in trading decisions. When a stock traded on high volume then is it is good time for active Investors to attain the opportunity of this situation. For every buyer, there needs to be someone who sold them the shares they bought, just as there must be a buyer in order for a seller to get rid of his or her shares. This battle between buyers and sellers for the best price in all different time frames creates movement while longer-term technical and fundamental factors play out. Using volume to analyze stocks can bolster profits and also reduce risk.

The beta factor is 1.54.Volatility shows sense of how far the stock will fall if the market takes a dive and how high stock will rise if the bull starts to climb. A stock with a beta more than 1 means high volatile and less than 1 means low volatile. Common shareholders want to know how profitable their capital is in the businesses they invest it in. The company gives a ROE of 16.60%. The higher the ROE, the better the company is at generating profits. ROI is 1.20%. A positive result means that returns exceed costs. Analysts therefore consider the investment a net gain. The opposite kind of result, a negative means that costs outweigh returns. Analysts therefore view the investment as a net loss. Return on Assets (ROA) ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The ROA is 1.10%. A company that manages their assets well will have a high return, while if manages their assets poorly will have a low return.

Five Things to Know: Ally Challenge,https://www.pgatour.com/champions/news/2018/09/9/five-things-to-know-for-the-ally-challenge.html,https://www.pgatour.com/,No,Liquidity,"The Ally Challenge is one of two new events upon us during this stretch of three tournaments in three weeks. It's new, but in a lot of ways, it's very familiar to both golf fans and many of the players that will compete. For example, Tom Pernice, Jr. will be making his 19th start at Warwick Hills. The PGA TOUR hosted the Buick Open at Warwick Hills from 1956 through the 2009 season. It might be more appropriate to say that the Ally Challenge is bringing professional golf back to Warwick Hills and Grand Blanc, Michigan. The field is absolutely packed to the rafters with past winners and the top players on the Charles Schwab Cup standings. Nine of the top ten on the Charles Schwab Cup standings will tee it up. The only player in the top 10 not in the field is No. 1 Miguel Angel Jimenez. 

Here are five things you should certainly know heading into the week.

1. Vijay Singh has to be a favorite

Vijay singh owned Warwick Hills. He won the Buick Open back-to-back years in 2004 and 2005. He also won in 1997. He made 11 starts at the Buick Open and had three wins and eight top 20 finishes. His scoring average over 42 rounds at Warwick Hills is 68.88. Further, he won a total of $2,258,437 from his performances over the years in Grand Blanc. So, safe to say that Warwick Hills helped his bank account. Singh's schedule has slowly increased since his first start on PGA TOUR Champions in 2013. He has already played in more events this year (13) than he did all of last season (12). He has a pair of wins and five top 10 finishes so far. 

2. Tiger Woods really loved Warwick Hills

Tiger Woods is the last man to hoist a trophy in a PGA TOUR sanctioned event at Warwick Hills. He won in 2009. Woods also won in Grand Blanc in 2006 and 2002. He made nine appearances in the Buick Open and his finishes are staggering: three wins, two second place finishes, a third and a fourth. His worst finish, yes worst, is a tie for 11th. He also had a milestone win. His 50th PGA TOUR win came at Warwick Hills in 2006 and the tournament had a cake made for him that was presented during the award ceremony. Woods earned almost $3.5 million in his career at Warwick Hills. 












3. History galore this week in Grand Blanc

Warwick Hills has so much history. The PGA TOUR first came to Grand Blanc in 1958. Billy Casper won the first year. The initial run was 12 straight years and then the event returned in 1977 and continued for 33 consecutive years. The list of winners at Warwick Hills is a whos who in golf circles: Peter Jacobsen (1980), Lanny Wadkins (1982), Brad Faxon (1991), Larry Mize (1993), Fred Couples (1994), Justin Leonard (1996) and Jim Furyk (2003). The first televised hole-in-one also took place at Warwick Hills during the PGA TOUR event when Jerry Barber made an ace in 1965. Unrelated to history, it's worth noting that the sponsor exemption this week is Michigan native Tom Gillis, who has made two starts on PGA TOUR Champions this year and has finished tied for third both times. Gillis is a Pontiac native and Lake Orion High School graduate. He won once on the Web.com Tour. 

4. Countdown to the Charles Schwab Cup Playoffs

There are just four events remaining before the top 72 begin the three-event Charles Schwab Cup Playoffs at the Dominion Energy Charity Classic from October 19-21. Over the next four events, players will jockey for position to qualify for the playoffs. It's interesting to note that No. 73 on the current Charles Schwab Cup standings is Rod Spittle, who announced his retirement after the Shaw Charity Classic. No. 74 is Christopher Williams, who has made just three starts this year. The high profile names on the bubble right now are Davis Love III at No. 68, Mark O'Meara at No. 66 and Larry Mize at No. 63. John Daly is also not a shoe-in by any means as he is teetering at No. 61. 

5. Events surrounding the tournament

Like all PGA TOUR Champions events, there will be a lot happening outside the ropes including a 5K race on Saturday morning, but the main draw is a Big & Rich concert on Friday night. Tournaments have spoiled the players and staff lately with some big name country acts. Blake Shelton recently performed at the DICK'S Sporting Goods Open.

World shares face longest losing streak since January 2016,http://www.euronews.com/2018/09/10/asian-shares-on-slippery-slope-as-trade-tensions-take-toll,http://www.euronews.com,Yes,Market,"LONDON (Reuters) - World shares were flirting with their longest run of declines since early 2016 on Monday, hit by rising anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war and another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this month.

Europe <.STOXX> defended its ground early on [.EU], but it was proving a struggle after a fresh sell-off by Chinese shares [.SS] pulled Asian <.MIAPJ0000PUS> and emerging-market equities <.MSCIEF> to 14-month lows.

Traders were bracing for a potential escalation in the Sino-U.S. tariff row after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in the dispute on Friday.

He said he was ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods in addition to the $200 billion already facing threatened tariffs.

On top of that, strong U.S. jobs numbers on Friday had bolstered bets on a higher dollar on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep raising U.S. interest rates. 

""It's more of the same, markets continue to be under pressure from a whole host of headwinds,"" said fund manager GAM's Investment Director of emerging market equities, Tim Love.

He pointed to the latest fall in China's currency, the yuan, which is now down almost 9 percent versus the dollar since April. ""You are back to the highly politically charged question - is this currency manipulation or not?""

Europe's resistance to the gloom was led by Milan, which jumped 1.5 percent <.FTMIB> as soothing comments on Italy's upcoming budget by Economy Minister Giovanni Tria pushed down the country's borrowing costs in the bond markets [GVD/EUR].

Stockholm <.OMXS30> also strengthened along with the Swedish crown <SEK=> after the nationalist Sweden Democrats gained less ground than expected in weekend elections.

The crown rose about 0.6 percent against the euro <EURSEK=> to 10.43 crowns. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.1566 after falling more than half a percent on Friday following the U.S. jobs data. [/FRX] 


FRAGILE CHINA 

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.9 percent to the lowest since July 2017, extending losses from last week when it dropped 3.5 percent for its worst weekly showing since mid-March.

Beijing had warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new trade measures. But it is running out of room to match them dollar-for-dollar, raising concern it would resort to other measures, such as weakening the yuan or taking action against U.S. companies in China.

Chinese shares were battered with the blue-chip index <.CSI300> off 1.4 percent. Shanghai's SSE Composite <.SSEC> fell 1.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index <.HSI> shed 1.3 percent.

Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended 0.3 percent higher after revised second-quarter data showed the world's third-biggest economy grew at its fastest pace since 2016.

Trump, who is challenging China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union on trade issues, has also expressed displeasure about the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 

The latest 14-month low for emerging-market shares came amid turbulence in Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and South Africa, where currencies have been routed recently [EMRG/FRX].

Some Asian economies are vulnerable, too, Nomura analysts said, with many countries burdened by high private debt. They also noted a ""concentration risk"" from some of the world's largest funds' heavy investments in emerging-market assets.

The Indian rupee hit a record low of 72.50 per dollar <INR=D2> and Indonesia's rupiah - Asia's second-worst performer <IDR=ID> this year - weakened 0.4 percent, near an all-time low.

""Given the latest comments from Trump, investors are likely to see the potential for further depreciation in EM currencies with the trade war cranking up yet another notch,"" said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia.

The Australian dollar <AUD=D3>, a proxy for Chinese growth because of the large amount of metals it sells there, hovered near its lowest in 2 1/2 years and was last at $0.7115. 

Copper tumbled over 1.2 percent to cement the 20 percent drop it has seen already this year. Spot gold was lower at $1,193.01 <XAU=>. 

Oil prices bucked the trend, after three straight days of losses. U.S. crude futures <CLc1> were up 44 cents at $68.20 per barrel and Brent crude futures <LCOc1> added 52 cents to $77.35 a barrel. [O/R]

Is Charles Schwab taking advantage of sweep account customers? ,https://nypost.com/2018/09/09/is-charles-schwab-taking-advantage-of-sweep-account-customers/,https://nypost.com/,Yes,Sales Practice,"Dear John: Charles Schwab is trying to pocket the spread between the higher rates for Treasury bills and the lower rate offered by Bank Sweep products.

A ?valued customer? gets 15 basis points in a sweep product instead of the 1.23 percent offered by the US Treasury money fund.

Yes, I receive FDIC insurance. However, this guarantee is secured by the good faith and security of the US government. I think T-bills offer a similar guarantee.

Shame on Schwab! You pocket basis points against billions of dollars of customer accounts. Anonymous.

Dear Anonymous: The first thing I?m curious about is, why didn?t you give your name? I only use initials in this column, so I guess you are afraid that Schwab will know which of their ?valued customers? has a gripe.

So I figure you didn?t complain to Schwab yourself, and you let me do your dirty work.

OK, I?m up for it.

Here?s what Schwab had to say:

Hi John,

?Thanks for contacting us and for the opportunity to respond to your reader?s note regarding cash solutions at Schwab. We believe cash plays an important role in any sound portfolio and that clients should have access to a wide range of cash options,? wrote a spokesman.

Then he says you have your cash in the wrong product.

?Clients should rarely leave money they intend to retain in cash for long periods of time in any sweep vehicle ? whether it is a sweep money market fund or a bank sweep feature. Long-term cash should typically be invested in a purchased money-market fund for liquidity or in FDIC-insured certificates of deposit,? the spokesman continued.

?By comparison, purchased money-market funds will generally pay higher interest yields than any sweep vehicle. Ultimately, the choice of where to put uninvested cash is up to each client.?

So there you are. And I guess Schwab really is pocketing the point spread between what you are invested in and what government bills are paying. Luckily for them, people often make this kind of mistake and are afraid to ask.

Dear John: Please help me. For over 25 years I paid timely premiums to Travelers Insurance for a homeowner?s policy, believing that I was protected.

Last September my house was vandalized by tenants to the point where the county declared my home ?uninhabitable.? The contractor?s estimate for repairs, obtained at Travelers? request, is $69,000.

My claim was denied. Travelers is avoiding honoring their commitment to me because I didn?t have a ?renters? policy.

How could I know that I had the wrong policy?

I trusted my insurance professional. The original policy was written when I used my beloved home for my own use. Eventually I began renting it out. This has been a nightmare. BG

Dear BG Your story is far different from the one I?m hearing from Travelers.

The company says you were warned about the policy being the wrong one and that you didn?t change it.

It?s truly a ?they said, you said.?

So I?m afraid your only recourse is to get a lawyer.

But this is a good lesson for others ? not necessarily about insurance. If you rent out your house, whether for a year, a month or overnight, you could end up losing a lot of things that are valuable to you.

So, don?t screw with the insurance company that covers your house.

Good luck on this one.

Millennial Women Are Poised To Be The Most Financially Independent Women In History,https://www.forbes.com/sites/megangorman/2018/09/09/millennial-women-are-poised-to-be-the-most-financially-independent-women-in-history/#586e73cc1d52,https://www.forbes.com/,No,Market,"

In late 2015, a new fashion trend hit: designer t-shirts emblazoned with the phrase ?The Future Is Female.? It was on point and women of all ages, especially those in their 20s and 30s embraced them.

It?s no surprise that Millennial women connected with these four words. For the first time in decades, feminism is on the upswing. From career progression to child rearing, Millennial women are taking on the world. They are making themselves the new future.

But the phrase ?The Future Is Female? is not new. It was first coined over forty years ago in 1975. The juxtaposition of this Seventies slogan on Millennial female life in the early twentieth century is quite the contrast. After all, when compared to where women were financially in the mid-70s, today?s twenty and thirty-something women are living in a different world. A world where they are likely to become the most financially independent women in history.



?Millennial women have more freedom with their finances than past generations ever did,? says Misty Lynch, a John Hancock financial advisor consulting for Twine?s Savings and Investing app. ?A married woman couldn?t even get her own credit card before 1975 without permission, and single women didn?t have it much easier when it came to financial independence.?

Clearly a lot has changed.

A Greater Opportunity For Independence


A look at recent data regarding Millennial women finds that they are enjoying opportunities unavailable to women before them. Pew Research has found that these women are more likely than men to have finished at least a bachelor?s degree?? by 7 percentage points. Further, 71% of Millennial women are in the workplace and they are marrying later versus previous generations as they focus on growing their careers.

All of this puts them in a different financial situation than previous generations. While the wind may be at their back, it is important that Millennial women have a clear understanding of what they need to do to maximize their financial lives, including taking their weaknesses head on.

Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, CFP, president of the Charles Schwab Foundation and SVP of Charles Schwab & Co, Inc., addresses the potential pitfalls. ?Longevity plus wage and opportunity discrimination means these women need to work harder, save more and be in charge of their finances because financial independence isn?t just a matter of strength; it?s a matter of necessity? says Schwab-Pomerantz.

Financial independence is not a sudden result but rather a lifelong journey where certain decisions and behaviors propel the individual ahead. Understanding where Millennial women need to develop more skills will help them on this road.

Developing Goals And Being Fearless About Investing

John Hancock?s Twine Savings and Investing app recently studied the financial behavior of young women ages 19-36. Forty-five percent of women surveyed said that when they set a financial goal they are motivated to achieve it. Goal orientation is key in amassing wealth as financial independence is a slow progressive journey.

On the whole, Millennial women display high confidence in areas of budgeting and bill paying but at times demonstrate a lack of confidence versus their male peers in terms of investing. The most appropriate next step for these women is to use their money strengths to gain confidence in investing and putting their money to work for them.

Alison Norris, CFP and Advice Strategist at SoFi, agrees. ?Instead of shying away from the topic with others, [Millennial women should] be confident discussing it at the dinner table with peers, asking their parents how they are paying for retirement, and initiating a salary conversation with their manager. When they open it up and start talking in a human way about money, the shackles fall off.?

This is even more imperative as Millennial women enter their prime child rearing years. Twine found that currently only one third of women in this group are investing outside of a 401(k).?? Without having clear financial goals, the disparity over a lifetime versus their male peers can cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Schwab-Pomerantz advises, ?Always try to live below your means. Living below your means and saving the difference is key to achieving long-term goals. If helpful, view your money in terms of trade-offs.  If I buy X, what am I giving up? Does spending money in this way support my long-term goals??

And this means Millennial women are going to have to move beyond one issue that came out of the Twine study: that you need at least a $1,000 to invest. With the advent of easy access to the markets at a low cost, these hurdles disappear.

Lynch concurs with this thinking. ?This assumption creates a false sense of intimidation for first-time investors.  Even $10 or $20 can get you going.?

As a result, by living below their means, even if just a few dollars, Millennial women need to capture these funds and put them to work. The advent of investing and savings apps makes this even easier.

Financial Independence Is A Journey

As Chantel Bonneau, financial advisor with Northwestern Mutual and a Millennial herself, noted, ?Finances are similar to fitness. Getting into your ideal shape doesn?t happen overnight. It is a process that requires, time, patience, and commitment. It?s also about moderation.?

Millennial women are poised to be the most financially independent generation in history. At the same time, ?The Future Is Female? T-shirts continue to sell. While it might be a fun fashion trend, in terms of financial independence, Millennial women need to embrace the opportunities they have today to grow their wealth.

Bond support depends on changes for seniors,https://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/bond-support-depends-on-changes-for-seniors-20180909,https://www.thegazette.com/,No,Market,"The front page article in the Aug. 14 paper on the upcoming Linn-Mar Community School District bond vote (?Linn-Mar counting on voters to back $55 million bond?) had a secondary headline ? ?lower bond, lower tax levy on second attempt to build schools? ? that we found misleading. 
   
The district?s share of our current property tax is 47 percent. The new, lower bond issue will push Linn-Mar?s share to nearly 50 percent. 
   
Set to hit fixed income property owners again, Linn-Mar needs to approach state legislators with a second angle to their bond issue. There are states that freeze property taxes for owners, once they reach age 65. Additionally, there are states that exempt Social Security and pension income from state income tax. More bond issues would pass if these senior tax issues were addressed. 
   
Cities could also help. Designate use of local-option sales tax revenue solely to local school boards, for construction and updating, by skipping all the ?pet projects.? Using LOST funds would have everyone?s skin in the game, not just property owners. 
   
Until the senior issues mentioned above are addressed, bonds will continue to receive our ?no? vote.
