At least that's what seems to be happening in the speculative-grade bond market http://www.businessinsider.com/category/bond-market , where the debt burden for nonfinancial firms is now above its previous peak seen before the 2008-2009 financial crisis.



This troubling development is the focal point of a new report from Moody's Investors Service http://www.businessinsider.com/category/moodys , which has the so-called junk-bond market firmly in its sights. The firm argues the large amount of outstanding high-yield debt is a ticking time bomb.



Of course, when it comes to markets, it takes two to tango, since corporate debt is only as valuable as the investors willing to buy it. As such, the swelling of the junk-bond market has coincided with insatiable demand from blindly confident traders looking to keep squeezing returns out of a susceptible market.



'The ranks of low rated issuers continue to swell due to easy market access in a stable credit environment where investors have been reaching for yield,' Mariarosa Verde, a senior credit officer at Moody's, wrote in the report. 'At the same time, the opportunity to borrow at low cost for mergers and acquisitions and to return capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchases has proved irresistible.'



'When defaults do eventually spike, credit losses are likely to be elevated,' she concluded. 'Some very weak issuers are living on borrowed time while benign conditions last.'



To be clear, the rating agency's point is not that a credit meltdown is imminent. Rather, it's arguing that when turbulence does eventually rock markets and cause defaults, the effect will be far exaggerated because of outsize risk-taking.



And, according to Moody's, traders don't appear ready to stop piling into junk bonds. The firm notes that as junk issuers reach their limits, investors are actually hedging less.



This type of mispricing has also caught the eye of Goldman Sachs, which pointed out last week that the credit-risk premium for CCC-rated bonds http://www.businessinsider.com/ultra-risky-market-segment-most-mispriced-since-financial-crisis-investor-impact-2018-5 â€” the riskiest segment of the high-yield universe â€” had fallen to negative 53 basis points, its lowest since 2007.



That type of pricing disconnect offers little bang for an investor's buck and is unattractive even at non-recession-like levels, according to Goldman, which recommends traders simply look elsewhere â€” even if owning junk has proved lucrative in recent months.



Good luck persuading them to change their tune. After all, it's their reckless behavior that has gotten us into this situation in the first place.



'The availability of credit and the overall increase in leverage at the speculative grade level has been facilitated by strong institutional investor demand for senior secured loans,' Verde said. 'The greater use of senior secured financing means that there is less junior debt cushion in speculative grade debt structures which raises the risk that in the next period of broad stress loan recoveries will be lower than they have been historically.'

Â·         European trades take 33 days to settle on average, LMA says 



Â·         Slow settlement deters investors from loans: Credit Suisse 



Credit markets were given a reminder this week of how quickly liquidity can evaporate as even the most highly-traded securities proved difficult https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-29/italian-bond-rout-driven-by-liquidity-vacuum-as-buyers-vanish  to shift in the turmoil sparked by Italyâ€™s political crisis.



Nowhere are investors more aware https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/old-habits-refuse-to-die-in-1-trillion-leveraged-loan-market  of that than in the leveraged loan market, where transactions can take weeks to settle. Pressure is now building for the market to adopt technology developed to run crypto-currencies like Bitcoin as a potential way to unlock one of the most arcane corners of finance.



The leveraged-loan market has grown to around $1.2 trillion, according to LCD, S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even so, it takes 33 days on average to settle transactions in Europe, the Loan Market Association says, versus two days for most stock and bond trades. Thatâ€™s restricting growth and blockchain is being touted by some participants as a potential solution.



â€œSlow settlement is a major deterrent to many of the investors looking at the loan market,â€ù said Charles Bennett, managing director in European credit sales at Credit Suisse Group AG. â€œTechnology is the answer to improving this process and blockchain looks to be in a really strong position.'







Loan market lobby groups are studying the technologyâ€™s potential impact on an industry that still depends on phone and even fax messages. The LMA recently ran a seminar http://www.lma.eu.com/events/fintech-seminar?p=1  that discussed how blockchain could shake up the market and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe has set up a working group looking into its possibilities. The New York-based Loan Syndications & Trading Association told https://www.lsta.org/news-and-resources/news/ops-and-blocks  members recently to â€œprepare for disruptive innovation.â€ù



The market for leveraged loans, used by the riskiest companies to raise cash, is traditionally controlled by banks acting as agents between borrowers and investors. Advances in blockchain since it was adopted by cryptocurrency providers to keep a digital tally of transactions, could limit the role of the so-called â€œgolden ledgerâ€ù in which banks record the identities of loan buyers, how much they hold and deal terms. That may address the current imbalance of data and high risk of error.





Manual Records





Lenders have to keep manual records on their holdings and the interest theyâ€™re due because they donâ€™t have access to the agentsâ€™ data. Phone calls and emails from investors checking their records match the ledger account for about 25 percent of agentsâ€™ operational costs, according to consulting firm Keystone Strategy. Blockchain could enable each investor to easily keep track of where they stand.



â€œA lot of the delay in settling trades comes from checking that all parties agree on the same terms,â€ù said Joseph Salerno, chief executive officer at fintech company Synaps Loans. â€œWith blockchain, they know the position recorded on the ledger is the authoritative version.â€ù



Synaps is developing a blockchain-based product that uses an algorithm to distribute loan information across a digital network of nodes or hubs, with each one hosted by a participant in the market, said Salerno. The company is a joint venture between tech firm Ipreo and blockchain startup Symbiont and was tested last year with 19 firms, including Barclays Plc, State Street Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.





More Transparent





Rival Finastra started offering https://www.finastra.com/news-events/press-releases/finastras-fusion-lendercomm-now-live-based-blockchain-architecture  a system in late April that it developed with software firm R3 and organizations including BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc and State Street.



â€œWith more transparency we can expect to see an increase in investors and more liquidity,â€ù said Jacqueline Morcombe, who is responsible for lending sales and strategy at Finastra.



But removing kinks from an old-fashioned system may not be straightforward. Agents who earn a fee from investors for every loan trade in Europe could oppose increased automation if it reduces their profits, said David Milward, London-based head of loans at Janus Henderson Investors.



â€œSome banks may see the agency function as a profit center, given the fees theyâ€™re generating, so they may resist more efficient trading,â€ù he said.





Complex Tasks





Agent banks also carry out some functions that new technology canâ€™t replace, such as know-your-customer procedures and handling borrower requests to veto certain lenders, according to Beth MacLean, a money manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., which oversees $1.8 trillion, including the worldâ€™s biggest bond mutual fund.



â€œUntil the technology can carry out those tasks, as well as more complex jobs like distributing interest and processing prepayments, I canâ€™t see it speeding up settlement,â€ù she said. Slow settlement â€œcan be a liquidity issueâ€ù during bouts of stress, though most managers have facilities in place to compensate, she said.



Instead of using blockchain to distribute loan information, financial data firm IHS Markit is exploring its use to speed up cash transfers.



Still, blockchain may eventually bring down costs and prompt agents to charge less, according to Nigel Houghton, managing director at the LMA.



'This tech may in time prove to bring down the cost of administering loan facilities such that lower fees are more readily contemplated,' he said.

JOE RENNISON, ALEXANDRA SCAGGS AND ERIC PLATT â€” NEW YORK

â€˜There is no point in talking about financial covenants any more. Cov-lite is the new normalâ€™

The size of the outstanding leveraged loan market has risen above $1tn as concerns about the expansion of add-backs and senior debt grow

 

Two years ago Valeant was under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and investors were questioning its opaque accounting. That meant the drugmaker had to pay dearly when it amended the terms of its loans to reduce its risk of default.

Now the Canadian company, which in July will rebrand itself as Bausch Health, is firmly in control of the refinancing of a loan. This shift in power between the drugmaker and investors is a striking example of white-hot demand for leveraged loans, or those made to speculative grade-rated borrowers.

Investor appetite for floating-rate debt is high as the US Federal Reserve stays on track to raise borrowing costs this year. This means companies such as Valeant have a wide open window for refinancing their existing loans â€” and on favourable terms.

Indeed, last month the size of the outstanding leveraged loan market rose above $1tn for the first  time, but such growth has brought a decline in credit quality. As Valeant boosted the size of its loan by $750m to $4.6bn, in a flexing of muscle that would have been unthinkable two years ago, it secured greater financial flexibility by loosening the covenants, or conditions, attached to its refinancing.

Fund manager Paul Dlugosch, who began shifting his portfolio into loans from high-yield bonds and convertible debt more than a year ago, said his allocation of nearly 20 per cent was probably the highest he was comfortable with. â€œItâ€™s pretty difficult to find good credits,â€ù said Mr Dlugosch, who manages the Buffalo High-Yield fund. â€œCovenants are definitely getting looser, and the pricing [for investors] is not as good.â€ù

Investors and bankers believe the trend towards loosening covenants risks costing fund managers when the credit cycle finally turns. After years of pressure, borrowers have almost entirely removed â€œmaintenance covenantsâ€ù, or metrics from their loans that they need to report to their lenders every quarter.

Now, the vast majority of loans are â€œcov-liteâ€ù, lacking covenants meant to govern a companyâ€™s financial metrics. According to data from S&P Global, the number of cov-lite loans in April rose to 82 per cent of loans tracked, up from about 20 per cent in 2011.

â€œThere is no point in talking about financial covenants any more, or calling a deal â€˜cov-liteâ€™,â€ù said Christina Padgett, a loan analyst at Moodyâ€™s. â€œThey are all cov-lite. Cov-lite is the new normal.â€ù Analysts warn that other lender protections are eroding as well. One of these is the privileged status of the senior lender. Companies are issuing a larger share of senior debt in response to booming demand for collateralised loan obligations, securitisation vehicles that primarily buy senior secured debt.

Companies are â€œextending the amount of the capital structure the senior secured debt is occupying, which means that if the company does falter, your cushion is much smaller than it used to be,â€ù said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments.

For example, Valeantâ€™s expanded senior secured term loan is designed to be the first to be paid in bankruptcy. But it will also effectively expand the share of debt in the same position, diluting investorsâ€™ claim on the groupâ€™s assets.

Some investors also worry about the proliferation of so-called add-backs to ebitda, a measure that often plays a key role in loan and bond contracts in setting limits on how much debt a borrower can take on.

One company that has expanded its add-backs is casino operator Caesars Entertainment. At some point between its buyout by private equity firms in 2008 and its exit from bankruptcy in 2017, the Las Vegas group gained the ability to add future restructuring costs back to its ebitda along with past costs.

The broader danger posed by add-backs is that they can hide the levels of corporate leverage by improving the appearance of profits.

Unfortunately, the rest of the market is even more opaque: Morgan Stanley analysts have reminded clients that their leverage data do not capture the two-thirds of loan issuers that do not file public financial information.

Rating agency Moodyâ€™s has found a growing share of leveraged loans are being issued by companies with low ratings. For investors this means there is a rising number of low-quality deals with no debt holders below them in the event of bankruptcy, potentially increasing their losses.

â€œIn the next credit cycle you will have the â€˜havesâ€™ and â€˜have notesâ€™, and the â€˜have notesâ€™ are likely to be in these loan-only capital structures,â€ù said Beth McLean, a portfolio manager at asset manager Pimco.

Some investors simply point out that lenders should properly scrutinise any ebitda add-backs and adjust prices for loans accordingly.

John Bell, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, said the key question for investors was whether they were lending money to companies with â€œreasonable creditsâ€™â€™ and concluded: â€œWe are not holding a bunch of loans that look like they have a bad capital structures.â€ù

""",,5/4/18,ClarI@corp.root.nasd.com,38:42.7,ClarI@corp.root.nasd.com,40:48.697,When Your Investing Robot Has A Mind Of Its Own,https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/05/18/when-your-investing-robot-has-a-mind-of-its-own/?mod=article_inline ,General,Wall Street Journal," ""Not many people would keep adding money to a brand-new investment that has lost 9% in its first four months. But a robot will.

Thatâ€™s what has been happening at Wealthfront Inc., the automated online investment manager, or robo-adviser, that manages about $10.5 billion. In January, the firm launched Wealthfront Risk Parity, a mutual fund that invests across stocks, bonds and commodities around the world. For many clients with at least $100,000 invested at Wealthfront, the firm has been automatically moving as much as 20% of their assets into the fund â€” unless they stipulated that they donâ€™t want it to.

Wealthfront has amassed $690 million in the fund and says it expects to hit $900 million soon. Some $440 million came in last month, according to Morningstar Inc., even as the fund lost 2.6% while the stock market and comparable risk-parity funds were up slightly.

As Wealthfrontâ€™s vice president for research, Jakub Jurek, rightly points out, four months is â€œjust noise,â€ù far too short a period to draw any conclusions about the success of a long-term investment strategy. And a similar approach has worked reasonably well in the hands of such leading investors as Bridgewater Associates, the worldâ€™s largest hedge-fund manager, and AQR Capital Management, which oversees $30 billion in similar strategies.

Even so, as Wealthfront continues frog-marching investors into the fund despite its poor initial performance, confusion reigns.

Its prospectus says the new fund should be used only by investors who understand complex securities, are highly risk-tolerant and who â€œintend to actively monitor and manage their investments in the fund.â€ù

The whole point of using an automated online firm like Wealthfront, however, is that you donâ€™t intend to actively monitor and manage your investments. You want its computers to do that for you, using exchange-traded funds that track the markets, minimize your costs and maximize your after-tax returns.

Unlike Bridgewater and AQR, the Wealthfront fund wonâ€™t own the underlying assets directly â€” and that could lead to some gaps.

As one of its hedges against inflation, it may own an ETF that holds energy stocks. So far this year, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund is up 9.7%, whereas crude oil has surged 18.3%.

As of its latest available regulatory filing, the Wealthfront fund was paying financing rates between 1.88% and 2.18% for its total-return swaps, the contracts it exchanges with banks to replicate the performance of various assets. Under accounting rules, those costs arenâ€™t reported in the fundâ€™s expenses, but they do come out of its net return.

That means the fund, which reduced its annual expenses to 0.25% from 0.5% last month, will need to earn better than 2% a year just to break even â€” a high hurdle.

The prospectus also says the fund may trade rapidly and could produce higher short-term capital gains than other strategies, potentially raising investorsâ€™ tax bills. Using swaps that mature in 13 months should enable realized profits to be taxed at the lower long-term capital-gains rate, Mr. Jurek says.

It isnâ€™t clear that everybody wants the risk-parity approach. At its heart, risk parity is simply a way of diversifying not by how much money you have in each type of asset, but by how much risk you are taking overall.

Stocks are far riskier than bonds. If you have 60% in stocks, they could account for 90% or more of your portfolioâ€™s total riskiness. Under risk parity, you borrow money to buy more bonds, commodities and other assets that reduce the risk of holding stocks â€” and may well make your overall portfolio safer.

Still, that makes sense only for people who are comfortable investing with borrowed money â€” and a lot of folks would rather take a nap on a bed of nails.

â€œIt may be presumptuous to roll investors automatically into a new product like this without making sure they first have a reasonable understanding of what to expect,â€ù says Adam Butler, chief investment officer at ReSolve Asset Management Inc., which manages approximately $300 million in Toronto.

Clients come to Wealthfront not just for its automation and low cost, but â€œbecause of the sophistication we are able to offer them,â€ù says spokeswoman Kate Wauck. â€œSo to us, offering risk parity is consistent with our clientsâ€™ expectations and our ethos as a firm.â€ù

Still, she says, â€œwe could have done a better job rolling this out and explaining it to clients.â€ù

Mr. Jurek says the new fund squares with Wealthfrontâ€™s traditional automated approach because the firm will manage the portfolio with a â€œrules-based strategyâ€ù rather than subjective judgment.

Looking back at decades of data, Wealthfront tested the hypothetical results and found the strategy would have produced a â€œvery attractive risk-adjusted, long-term rate of return,â€ù Mr. Jurek says.

That multi-decade test, he says, â€œspeaks much more loudly to us than any one month.â€ù

In the long run, this fund might turn out to be a decent idea. In the short run, itâ€™s a reminder that hiring a robo-adviser instead of a human adviser doesnâ€™t mean you no longer need to pay attention.

""",,5/18/18,ClarI@corp.root.nasd.com,46:28.0,SharmaNa@corp.root.nasd.com,45:05.7105,Wealthfront Wants to Make Investing Complicated Again,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-11/wealthfront-wants-to-make-investing-complicated-again ,General,Bloomberg," ""Wealthfront Inc., an online money manager, attracted a following in Silicon Valley and expanded its assets under management to $10 billion by offering a simple proposition. 



Instead of telling clients which stocks to buy or which supposedly brilliant money manager to pick, Wealthfront charges a low fee to help people spread their assets among exchange-traded funds that passively track the market. It adjusts that allocation to stocks, bonds, and other assets according to a clientâ€™s tolerance for risk.



Customers loved Wealthfrontâ€™s passive investments. In February, however, the company added something new. The Wealthfront Risk Parity Fund is automatically included in accounts with more than $100,000 in taxable assets unless the client opts out. The fund is supposed to follow an approach taken by hedge fund manager Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates. Only a portion of clientsâ€™ money would be invested in it, the rest going into more traditional fare such as low-cost Vanguard funds. Rather than cheering at the opportunity to invest like an exclusive hedge fund, some Wealthfront clients expressed puzzlement about an unusual strategy with added expenses. â€œIâ€™m not bailing on Wealthfront yet, but I am opting out of Risk Parity until someone can better explain to me why I should have it over passive investing,â€ù tweeted Austin Johnsen, head of corporate development at the game streaming site Twitch Interactive Inc.

Wealthfrontâ€™s plunge into risk parity represents one of the biggest attempts yet to take the strategy into the mainstream. A handful of other mutual funds offer some version of the approach, but itâ€™s largely been the domain of hedge funds and institutional investors. There may be as much as $500 billion invested in risk parity, making it common enough that itâ€™s sometimes singled out as a likely suspectâ€”fairly or notâ€”for unexplained bouts of volatility in stock and bond markets. Last year, Paul Tudor Jones II, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corp., said risk parity could act as â€œthe hammer on the downsideâ€ù when turmoil returns to equity markets as managers rush to adjust their strategies.



So what the heck is it? The strategy begins from a premise familiar to many investors: diversification. For example, in addition to stocks, you want to have some bonds, which wonâ€™t necessarily fall in value at the same time as equities. The problem, risk-parity advocates say, is that even if youâ€™re split pretty evenly between stocks and bonds, most of the volatility in your portfolio will come from the equities. In a bear market, holding even a little bit in stocks can expose you to losses. You can equalize this by tilting more heavily to bonds, but then you end up in a low-risk portfolio that gives up potential return.



Many risk-parity funds try to solve this with leverage. A manager might create a portfolio heavily exposed to the bond market but do so using derivatives that increase the value of the fundâ€™s bets, magnifying potential gains as well as potential losses. The hope is that the fund will provide some protection when the stock market drops but deliver higher returns than a simple bond-heavy portfolio. Throw in exposure to other asset classes, such as commodities, real estate investment trusts, and emerging-market bonds, and the risk is even more spread out.



Risk parity looked really good during the financial crisis, when stocks fell sharply. A long stretch of strong bond returns also helped. But lately bond yields have been rising, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury at about 3 percent. (Bonds fall in value as yields and interest rates rise.) JPMorgan Asset Management, Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital, and others say a bond bear market is on the way. If so, some risk-parity strategies could be in for a bumpier ride.



The approach varies in terms of how complicated or simple it is, with each firm having its own spin. Wealthfrontâ€™s fund gets leveraged exposure to asset classes using derivatives called swaps. The fund reweights investments to try to keep the portfolio at a set level of annual volatility, but thatâ€™s just a target. The prospectus says actual volatility could fall above or below the fundâ€™s goal. Wealthfrontâ€™s website says it doesnâ€™t consider this active management, because itâ€™s a â€œrules-basedâ€ù approach.



Risk-parity elements such as leverage and other complicated inputs have historically been confined to quantitative money managers working with sophisticated investors. Thereâ€™s a reason for that. Individual investors shouldnâ€™t be putting money in strategies they donâ€™t understand well, says Maneesh Shanbhag, who, after five years at Bridgewater, co-founded Greenline Partners. â€œThe issue isnâ€™t that itâ€™s a bad strategy. Itâ€™s that investors donâ€™t know when theyâ€™ll underperform and outperform and why,â€ù he says. â€œTheyâ€™ll sell at the bottom, while an informed investor stays in.â€ù



Wealthfront has acknowledged some investor qualms, specifically about costs. The risk-parity fund originally had an expense ratio of 0.5 percent of assets per year. That compares with expenses averaging 0.15 percent for other ETFs in Wealthfrontâ€™s portfolios. Because of the backlash, the company cut its expense ratio to 0.25 percent just a couple of months after the fundâ€™s launch. Andy Rachleff, a co-founder of Wealthfront, told Bloomberg News in April he was caught by surprise when customers were upset about the higher fee. â€œWe thought continuing our policy of always delivering existing services at better prices than available would be compelling,â€ù he said, adding that if he could launch the product over again, he would have chosen the lower fee to begin with. â€œMost of our clients shared our excitement on the launch of Risk Parity, and we have significant assets committed to the fund,â€ù says Wealthfront spokeswoman Kate Wauck. About $900 million is committed, although some is still in the process of being moved to the fund in a tax-efficient way.



Investing by and large has been getting simpler for individuals, who can diversify broadly across markets at a very low cost. But fund companies and advisers still want to be able to offer an edge to justify even low fees in an increasingly cost-competitive market. â€œI look at it as this race occurring to add more strategies, more capabilities,â€ù says Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC. In short, complexity isnâ€™t dead.



BOTTOM LINE - Wealthfront built its business on helping people get into simple, low-cost investments. Now itâ€™s putting some clients into a strategy favored by hedge funds.

The fund is aimed at helping Wealthfront implement a risk parity strategy for taxable accounts that have at least $100,000. Risk parity strategies are based on allocations of risk inside a portfolio, as opposed to the the more common practice of allocating based on risk-adjusted return expectations. 



In a blog post announcing the strategy, Wealthfront said risk parity will help deliver 'higher risk-adjusted returns in a wide range of market environments.' 



The company, which touts itself as a low-cost and transparent provider, said it created its own mutual fund in order to preserve the value of its tax-loss harvesting and portfolio line of credit programs. 



Wealthfront said its mutual fund's 0.50% expense ratio is identical to Bridgewater's All-Weather fund and half of AQR Capital Management's Risk Parity fund, while having a fraction of the investment minimum. The company said risk parity will increase an investor's weighted average annual expense ratio by 0.08 percent. 



'It's important to us to be transparent about what we charge to invest your money,' the company blog stated. Wealthfront did not respond to a request for comment.



Some questioned exactly how transparent Wealthfront is being, and wondered why the robo-adviser is inviting the same conflict-of-interest questions it has traditionally avoided. 

Micah Hauptman, financial services counsel at Consumer Federation of America, a consumer research, education and advocacy organization, said Wealthfront's stated cost to investors doesn't include the cost of a total return swap. By taking assumptions from Wealthfront's white paper, costs could be as high as 1.25%, which Mr. Hauptman said could increase as interest rates rise. 



'I'm pretty surprised and frankly baffled by what they are doing,' he said.

Mr. Hauptman focuses on investment products for retail investors and how they get financial advice, typically regarding fiduciary issues, and the CFA has supported the digital advice business model of offering low-cost, market-tracking funds. 



'In the vast majority of instances, most retail investors just need very simple, efficient, low-cost portfolios,' Mr. Hauptman said. 'I'm not bashing risk parity or any other type of strategy, but why in this case? Of all the strategies and all the products that are available on the market, why this strategy?'



The CFA isn't opposed to offering in-house funds, but it is concerned if Wealthfront's mutual fund is more expensive than other products if offers just to generate more revenue, he said. 

'By offering their own proprietary fund, they're effectively increasing their cost to investors but also the fees they bring in,' Mr. Hauptman said. 'If they are looking to add a revenue stream, why not just add it to their advisory fee?' 



The biggest question is why Wealthfront has only implemented risk parity into its taxable accounts, he said. Not only will the process of converting accounts over to this mutual fund be a taxable event, but according to his reading of the white paper, the strategy isn't very tax-efficient. 



The cynic could say that Wealthfront isn't adding risk parity to retirement accounts because it won't pass muster with the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. 



A more innocuous viewpoint could be that Wealthfront is just looking for new ways to differentiate itself by telling consumers that it can offer low-cost access to hedge funds, Mr. Hauptman said. 



Meb Faber, chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management, said in a note on Twitter that the fund is 'probably a fine product' with fees that are in line with separate accounts and cheaper than most mutual funds. 



However, the Wealthfront fund uses total return swaps that are not included in the fee, and could add about .25% in extra costs, he estimated.

In counterclaims LJM raised Wednesday in a Manhattan federal court filing, the fund manager wrote that Wells Fargo Securities responded to volatility on Feb. 5 by terminating its futures commission merchant agreement with LJM on the spot and ordering an immediate liquidation of the entire portfolio, overriding LJMâ€™s plans for containing the losses.



The filing responds to a Wells suit seeking to recover $16.4 million extended to LJM.

LJM had three other futures commission merchants, and none asked for similar actions, LJM said.



In addition to rejecting Wells's claims, the filing levels counterclaims, accusing Wells Fargo of breaching its agreement with LJM as well as its fiduciary duty and of negligence, and seeks unspecified damages.

At least that's what seems to be happening in the speculative-grade bond market http://www.businessinsider.com/category/bond-market , where the debt burden for nonfinancial firms is now above its previous peak seen before the 2008-2009 financial crisis.



This troubling development is the focal point of a new report from Moody's Investors Service http://www.businessinsider.com/category/moodys , which has the so-called junk-bond market firmly in its sights. The firm argues the large amount of outstanding high-yield debt is a ticking time bomb.



Of course, when it comes to markets, it takes two to tango, since corporate debt is only as valuable as the investors willing to buy it. As such, the swelling of the junk-bond market has coincided with insatiable demand from blindly confident traders looking to keep squeezing returns out of a susceptible market.



'The ranks of low rated issuers continue to swell due to easy market access in a stable credit environment where investors have been reaching for yield,' Mariarosa Verde, a senior credit officer at Moody's, wrote in the report. 'At the same time, the opportunity to borrow at low cost for mergers and acquisitions and to return capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchases has proved irresistible.'



'When defaults do eventually spike, credit losses are likely to be elevated,' she concluded. 'Some very weak issuers are living on borrowed time while benign conditions last.'



To be clear, the rating agency's point is not that a credit meltdown is imminent. Rather, it's arguing that when turbulence does eventually rock markets and cause defaults, the effect will be far exaggerated because of outsize risk-taking.



And, according to Moody's, traders don't appear ready to stop piling into junk bonds. The firm notes that as junk issuers reach their limits, investors are actually hedging less.



This type of mispricing has also caught the eye of Goldman Sachs, which pointed out last week that the credit-risk premium for CCC-rated bonds http://www.businessinsider.com/ultra-risky-market-segment-most-mispriced-since-financial-crisis-investor-impact-2018-5 â€” the riskiest segment of the high-yield universe â€” had fallen to negative 53 basis points, its lowest since 2007.



That type of pricing disconnect offers little bang for an investor's buck and is unattractive even at non-recession-like levels, according to Goldman, which recommends traders simply look elsewhere â€” even if owning junk has proved lucrative in recent months.



Good luck persuading them to change their tune. After all, it's their reckless behavior that has gotten us into this situation in the first place.



'The availability of credit and the overall increase in leverage at the speculative grade level has been facilitated by strong institutional investor demand for senior secured loans,' Verde said. 'The greater use of senior secured financing means that there is less junior debt cushion in speculative grade debt structures which raises the risk that in the next period of broad stress loan recoveries will be lower than they have been historically.'

Nowhere are investors more aware https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/old-habits-refuse-to-die-in-1-trillion-leveraged-loan-market  of that than in the leveraged loan market, where transactions can take weeks to settle. Pressure is now building for the market to adopt technology developed to run crypto-currencies like Bitcoin as a potential way to unlock one of the most arcane corners of finance.



The leveraged-loan market has grown to around $1.2 trillion, according to LCD, S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even so, it takes 33 days on average to settle transactions in Europe, the Loan Market Association says, versus two days for most stock and bond trades. Thatâ€™s restricting growth and blockchain is being touted by some participants as a potential solution.



â€œSlow settlement is a major deterrent to many of the investors looking at the loan market,â€ù said Charles Bennett, managing director in European credit sales at Credit Suisse Group AG. â€œTechnology is the answer to improving this process and blockchain looks to be in a really strong position.'







Loan market lobby groups are studying the technologyâ€™s potential impact on an industry that still depends on phone and even fax messages. The LMA recently ran a seminar http://www.lma.eu.com/events/fintech-seminar?p=1  that discussed how blockchain could shake up the market and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe has set up a working group looking into its possibilities. The New York-based Loan Syndications & Trading Association told https://www.lsta.org/news-and-resources/news/ops-and-blocks  members recently to â€œprepare for disruptive innovation.â€ù



The market for leveraged loans, used by the riskiest companies to raise cash, is traditionally controlled by banks acting as agents between borrowers and investors. Advances in blockchain since it was adopted by cryptocurrency providers to keep a digital tally of transactions, could limit the role of the so-called â€œgolden ledgerâ€ù in which banks record the identities of loan buyers, how much they hold and deal terms. That may address the current imbalance of data and high risk of error.





Manual Records





Lenders have to keep manual records on their holdings and the interest theyâ€™re due because they donâ€™t have access to the agentsâ€™ data. Phone calls and emails from investors checking their records match the ledger account for about 25 percent of agentsâ€™ operational costs, according to consulting firm Keystone Strategy. Blockchain could enable each investor to easily keep track of where they stand.



â€œA lot of the delay in settling trades comes from checking that all parties agree on the same terms,â€ù said Joseph Salerno, chief executive officer at fintech company Synaps Loans. â€œWith blockchain, they know the position recorded on the ledger is the authoritative version.â€ù



Synaps is developing a blockchain-based product that uses an algorithm to distribute loan information across a digital network of nodes or hubs, with each one hosted by a participant in the market, said Salerno. The company is a joint venture between tech firm Ipreo and blockchain startup Symbiont and was tested last year with 19 firms, including Barclays Plc, State Street Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.





More Transparent





Rival Finastra started offering https://www.finastra.com/news-events/press-releases/finastras-fusion-lendercomm-now-live-based-blockchain-architecture  a system in late April that it developed with software firm R3 and organizations including BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc and State Street.



â€œWith more transparency we can expect to see an increase in investors and more liquidity,â€ù said Jacqueline Morcombe, who is responsible for lending sales and strategy at Finastra.



But removing kinks from an old-fashioned system may not be straightforward. Agents who earn a fee from investors for every loan trade in Europe could oppose increased automation if it reduces their profits, said David Milward, London-based head of loans at Janus Henderson Investors.



â€œSome banks may see the agency function as a profit center, given the fees theyâ€™re generating, so they may resist more efficient trading,â€ù he said.





Complex Tasks





Agent banks also carry out some functions that new technology canâ€™t replace, such as know-your-customer procedures and handling borrower requests to veto certain lenders, according to Beth MacLean, a money manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., which oversees $1.8 trillion, including the worldâ€™s biggest bond mutual fund.



â€œUntil the technology can carry out those tasks, as well as more complex jobs like distributing interest and processing prepayments, I canâ€™t see it speeding up settlement,â€ù she said. Slow settlement â€œcan be a liquidity issueâ€ù during bouts of stress, though most managers have facilities in place to compensate, she said.



Instead of using blockchain to distribute loan information, financial data firm IHS Markit is exploring its use to speed up cash transfers.



Still, blockchain may eventually bring down costs and prompt agents to charge less, according to Nigel Houghton, managing director at the LMA.



'This tech may in time prove to bring down the cost of administering loan facilities such that lower fees are more readily contemplated,' he said.

The White House said in a statement that the United States would move ahead with its plan to levy 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of imported Chinese goods, despite recent remarks by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/politics/mnuchin-kudlow-china-trade.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fana-swanson&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=7&pgtype=collection , and other administration officials that the tariffs would be suspended while the countries continued their negotiations.



The administration had previously announced a list of goods that would be subject to tariffs, including flat-screen TVs and medical devices. It then held a series of hearings on the tariffs, giving the public a chance to influence the final list. The White House said it would detail the final list of goods that will be subject to the tariffs by June 15, and the duties would be imposed shortly after that, the statement said.



The White House said the Trump administration would also move forward with restrictions on Chinese investment and with stronger export controls meant to limit the access that Chinese people and companies have to American technology â€” a measure the administration said was for national security purposes.



 



Those restrictions will be announced by June 30 and adopted soon after that, the administration said, adding that the United States would also continue to pursue a trade case it has filed against China at the World Trade Organization involving intellectual property rights.



Trade talks between the two countries will continue, the statement said, and the United States has asked Beijing to remove â€œall of its many trade barriersâ€ù that prevent American companies from doing business in China, and has also said that â€œtariffs and taxes between the two countries be reciprocal in nature and value.â€ù



The White House has planned to send Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, to China on June 2 to continue the trade negotiations. The last round of talks concluded on May 19 with the countries announcing little progress toward resolving a long list of complaints the American negotiators had previously identified. President Trump subsequently said he was not satisfied with the negotiations, and that they had a â€œlong way to go.â€ù



Mr. Trump has often talked about challenging what he has described as Chinaâ€™s unfair trade practices, but his advisers are deeply divided over the best course for doing so. Some, like Mr. Mnuchin, have focused on a potential compromise deal that would require China to buy huge amounts of American products while still forestalling the possibility of a trade war.



 



Other advisers have pushed for tougher action, demanding that China make substantial reforms to its economy to end the subsidies it provides to developing industries and to allow American companies equal access in the Chinese market. Those requests in particular have provoked a backlash from China, which has threatened its own potential set of tariffs on $50 billion in American goods.



 



On Friday, Mr. Trump said he had reached a deal https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/us/politics/trump-trade-zte.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fana-swanson&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection  that would allow the embattled Chinese telecom firm ZTE to remain in business, raising criticism and fears from Congress that he was backing off from his tougher promises on trade.



 



ZTE has been hit with tough sanctions by the United States, and its fate had become a bargaining chip in negotiations, with President Xi Jinping of China appealing directly to Mr. Trump for help.

Under the bill, written by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. would have to establish a fund financed by Finra fine money to cover awards that firms and brokers fail to pay to customers who win arbitration claims.



Ms. Warren has been critical of the ongoing problem of unpaid Finra arbitration awards. Now a Republican, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, has cosponsored her legislation https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018.3.6%20compensation%20for%20cheated%20investors%20bill%20text.pdf .



'This bill aims to compensate Americans who have been cheated out of hundreds of millions of dollars,' Mr. Kennedy said in a May 15 statement https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/kennedy-joins-warren-on-legislation-to-compensate-investors-cheated-by-brokers-and-dealers . 'These investors have already been swindled out of their money once, and thousands of them still haven't been given their unpaid arbitration. Our bill aims to fix that.' 



The Republican support elevates the topic of unpaid arbitration, according to Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities attorney and president of the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association.



'It's now become a bipartisan issue,' Mr. Stoltmann said. 



Although getting any legislation through Congress is a heavy lift â€” especially during an election year â€” Republican support for Ms. Warren's measure gives it momentum.



'It increases the likelihood of the bill being enacted, considerably,' said David Burton, senior fellow in economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. 



A spokeswoman for Senate Banking Committee chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, did not respond to a request for comment. A companion House bill has not been introduced.



In a report released earlier this year http://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_perspectives_on_customer_recovery.pdf?utm_source=MM&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=NewsRelease_020818_FINAL , Finra revealed that unpaid arbitration awards from 2012 to 2016 ranged from $14 million in 2016 to $75 million in 2013. That report outlined several options to address this http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20180208/FREE/180209910/finra-more-than-a-quarter-of-arbitration-awards-go-unpaid , including establishing a pool of money to fund unpaid arbitration. But Finra did not endorse any of the options and said it wanted to collaborate with other financial regulators on the problem.



Finra is not taking a position on Ms. Warren's bill.



'We appreciate the interest in how to best address this issue, and we're happy to engage in dialogue with anyone who has ideas about how to address it,' Finra chief executive Robert Cook said on the sidelines of the Finra annual conference in Washington on May 21.



Over the last several years, the amount of fines Finra assessed would easily cover the amount of unpaid arbitration, according to one of Mr. Burton's recent blog posts https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/elizabeth-warrens-proposal-would-help-wronged-investors .



The fact that the bill would not tap taxpayer funds but rather would be funded by 'the bad guys' who violate Finra rules should make it a popular approach on Capitol Hill, according to Mr. Stoltmann. 



'It's really appealing now to Democrats and Republicans,' he said.

Much of the growth comes from broker-dealers and other central distribution hubs that are launching new funds to fill the model portfolios they build.

Mutual funds managed by multiple unaffiliated subadvisors took in $18.1 billion in net flows during 2017, according to the Cerulli report, â€œU.S. Subadavisory Marketplace 2018: Shifting Product Use Drives a Changing Landscape.â€ù



Such sales success has helped these types of managersâ€™ piece of the subadvised pie grow from 26.5% of net subadvised assets in 2016 to 29.2% at the end of 2017, report author Brendan Powers says. Meanwhile, the share of subadvised assets in funds that rely on a single unaffiliated subadvisor fell from 58.4% in 2016 to 56.4% in 2017. Assets in funds with both affiliated and unaffiliated subadvisors dropped by 1 percentage point, to 14.1%.

The shift in market share stems mainly from the entrance of new sponsors using multi-subadvisor relationships, says Powers.



â€œThose new sponsors are typically characterized by being distributors with a captive pool of assets where they have a high level of discretion,â€ù Powers says.



That includes fund lineups such as Edward Jonesâ€™s Bridge Builder suite and Brinker Capitalâ€™s Destinations funds. Morningstar is also set to join the market later this year with multi-managed funds that it says it plans to use within the model portfolios made by its investment management subsidiaries, while turnkey asset management platform Symmetry Partners filed to launch funds for its models in April.



Older multi-managed products used in home office models include Morgan Stanley Wealth Managementâ€™s TRAK line, UBSâ€™s Pace funds and LPLâ€™s Optimum Funds, which are managed by Macquarieâ€™s Delaware Funds unit, which in turn hires third parties.

Model providers and home offices are turning to proprietary, multi-managed funds amid a â€œbarbellingâ€ù of the advice market, Powers says.



At one end, sophisticated advisors are making their own investment decisions, while advisors with less investment expertise more frequently rely on models. For home offices, building proprietary funds can help lower investor cost, and exert greater control over the investments their advisors recommend, he says.



The new multi-managed products have garnered interest because they offer diversification and simplicity to investors, says Jeff Keil of Keil Fiduciary Services. The arrangement also allows sponsors to shift allocations quickly and easily by moving assets between subadvisors, and spares them from having to find a new subadvisor or make large, taxable trades in client accounts.



â€œThe trend makes sense; from a lot of different standpoints itâ€™s easier and better and makes more sense for everybody involved,â€ù Keil says.

Sponsors of multi-managed products typically turn to outside subadvisors out of a desire to access top managers, Powers says. All of the sponsors surveyed by Cerulli identified access to best-of-breed managers as a driver in selecting unaffiliated firms, and 77% of the more than 15 sponsors that participated in the research said it was a significant driver. (Story continues below graphic.)

Subadvisors are optimistic about multi-managed products, according to Cerulliâ€™s report. Only 3.6% of more than 15 firms surveyed by Cerulli said they see little to no opportunity in multi-subadvisor mutual funds, compared to 20.7% who see few to no opportunities in single-subadvisor arrangements.



Natixis has seen increased demand for its strategies in multi-managed subadvisory solutions, head of institutional sales Robert Hussey says. Two of its affiliates, Loomis Sayles and Harris Associates, landed mandates on Morningstarâ€™s funds.



â€œWe believe the trend for multi-managed solutions is being driven by numerous factors,â€ù Hussey says in an e-mail. Those include the desire from sponsors to find unique sources of alpha and deliver diversified return streams, and the impact of capacity constraints in certain asset classes, such as small-caps and alternatives, Hussey says.

At the same time, subadvisors face consolidation, according to Legg Mason head of retirement solutions Will Coleman. Bigger firms with established reputations, and boutiques that can offer â€œsomething interesting,â€ù will survive. But many midsize firms will need to merge to achieve scale or risk getting eaten up by larger competitors, he says.



The squeeze comes as sponsors are â€œreally trying to narrow down, select, letâ€™s say, 10 strategic partners where we can grow together,â€ù Coleman says.



Some small subadvisors are also getting pushed out by compliance concerns, Keil says. The due diligence process has become more involved as sponsors focus on cyber security and disaster preparedness, leading them to bigger shops with more resources. But small firms can get ahead on performance if theyâ€™re nimble enough to pursue opportunities larger competitors canâ€™t, Keil says.

In fact, growing firms are looking for subadvisory mandates as a means to build scale, Cerulli found. Eighty-three percent of subadvisors surveyed by the researchers said they view subadvisory as â€œan effective way for our firm to tap new markets,â€ù while 60% identified winning mandates as a major strategic business focus.

Amid the market changes, subadvisors have been squeezed on fees. Nearly all of the managers surveyed by Cerulli â€” 96% â€”expect downward fee pressure will be a challenge for subadvisory in mutual funds and ETFs.

The competition for mandates on multi-managed funds in particular â€œwill likely make it so that some firms are willing to try and dip down and accept a lower fee,â€ù Cerulliâ€™s Powers says.

Legg Mason and its affiliates, which collectively nabbed three mandates on the Morningstar products, have seen pressure on fees across the board, Coleman says.

But there is an upside: With sponsors, and distributors more broadly, rationalizing the number of managers they work with, there are â€œbillions upon billions in assets that are now up for grabs,â€ù he says. Approaching that opportunity creatively can help address broader fee pressure, he adds.



â€œWith the fee concessions, we hope to have access to much more money thatâ€™s in motion,â€ù Coleman says.

Â·       The brokerage must make $19 million in restitution, averaging $164 to Maine fund participants.



 



Some Mainers who invested in NextGen college savings plans will receive restitution payments because state regulators determined that Merrill Lynch steered them into inappropriate plans.



According to a consent order, Merrill Lynch failed to supervise its agents who were advising investors opening 529 college savings plans, known as the NextGen Client Select Series. The state said that many investors were put into Class C shares, which are best for those investing for a short period. Over time, Merrill Lynch gets higher fees from those investments than the Class A accounts intended for longer-term investors.



The NextGen fund totaled nearly $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2017, for which Merrill Lynch was paid nearly $40 million in fees to manage.



Bill Norbert, a spokesman for the Finance Authority of Maine, said Merrill Lynch detected the inappropriate investments and reported them to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a nonprofit financial industry oversight organization. FAME administers the NextGen program in Maine.



Judith Shaw, the administrator of the Maine Office of Securities, which issued the order, said that until 2006 only one class of shares â€“ the one geared toward long-term investments â€“ was available to those with NextGen college savings accounts. After the second class was added, she said, Merrill Lynch didnâ€™t have systems to compare the age of the beneficiary with the investment class. That meant company supervisors werenâ€™t alerted if a savings plan was opened for a young child but put in a higher-fee plan geared toward those with a shorter investment horizon. That option charged fees over a period of time that ended up being more expensive than those that charged fees upfront.



â€œWe think it was really a failure of Merrill Lynchâ€™s overall supervisory system,â€ù Shaw said, a failure that has now been fixed. â€œMoney set aside for educational expenses should be used to pay for education, not unnecessary fees.â€ù



Shaw also said the problems seemed to occur with those who saw Merrill Lynch advisers and signed up for college savings plans in person. Those who set up accounts online were automatically directed to the long-term class of investments that charges fees upfront, but results in lower fees over time.



Merrill Lynch is making restitution of nearly $19 million to about 50,000 accounts in the U.S. under the order. In Maine, Norbert said, 673 NextGen accounts were affected and are receiving an average credit of $164. Merrill Lynch is also paying $500,000 to the Maine Securities Investor Education and Training Fund in lieu of paying a civil penalty.



Shaw said that program provides financial literacy training to teachers, as well as investor awareness programs, particularly those geared toward the elderly. The program also produces publications on safe investing.



In a statement, Merrill Lynch stressed that it uncovered and reported that investors were being steered into inappropriate accounts.



â€œMerrill Lynch self-identified this matter,â€ù the investment company said. â€œWe have worked closely with the state to provide refunds to affected clients.â€ù



Shaw said NextGen grants administered by the Harold Alfond College Challenge program were not affected by the order. Under that program, all Maine newborns receive $500 put into a NextGen savings plan opened on their behalf.

By Jackie Noblett June 25, 2018

ETF sponsors are investing heavily in people and technology to come up with new ideas for smart-beta and other specialized indexes, but there are signs that some shops are questioning the need to run those benchmarks in-house.



This month OppenheimerFunds and VictoryShares announced they would be turning over to third parties the sponsorship of benchmarks created and run by internal units. Both shops took on index administration responsibilities through the acquisition of ETF sponsors whose products were built on proprietary benchmarks. For OppenheimerFunds, it was the acquisition of VTL Associates in 2015 and for Victory Capital, it was the 2014 purchase of Compass Efficient Model Portfolios.



The moves to outsource the management of internally developed indexes come as regulators step up scrutiny of so-called â€œcustom indexesâ€ù and the influence that product manufacturers can have on the administration of the benchmarks their products track. The SEC has made reviews of funds that use custom indexes an exam priority. Meanwhile, managers who sell self-indexed products in Europe must contend with new registration and oversight obligations that went into effect in January.



While neither Oppenheimer nor Victory says regulatory pressures prompted their decisions, consultants, index providers and attorneys say the oversight concerns combined with the costs and complexity of maintaining an at-scale index business might be more than some shops want to bear.



â€œA lot of banks and asset managers have done a review and realized index administration is not a core business for them â€” itâ€™s costly to do and not a good use of their capital,â€ù says Rick Redding, head of the Index Industry Association, a group representing third-party index providers.



OppenheimerFunds earlier this month moved six of its revenue-weighted ETFs off of proprietary indexes to ones run by S&P Dow Jones Indices. They are the Oppenheimer Large Cap Revenue ETF, now known as the Oppenheimer S&P 500 Revenue ETF; the Oppenheimer Mid Cap Revenue ETF, now the Oppenheimer S&P MidCap 400 Revenue ETF; the Oppenheimer Small Cap Revenue ETF, now the Oppenheimer S&P SmallCap 600 Revenue ETF; the Oppenheimer Financials Sector Revenue ETF, now the Oppenheimer Financials Revenue ETF; and the Oppenheimer Ultra Dividend ETF, now the Oppenheimer S&P Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF.



The New York-based shop already used S&P as calculation agent and S&Pâ€™s broad-based benchmarks as a starting point for their revenue-screened strategies, so switching index sponsorship allows them to realize some of the branding and resource benefits of the blue-chip index provider, says Dave Mazza, head of ETF investment strategy for OppenheimerFunds.



â€œFrom an optics perspective, it allows us to leverage the halo that S&P can deliver to a fund,â€ù he says.



Oppenheimer has been using third-party index providers on some of its other ETFs, such as its single-factor and dynamic multi-factor smart-beta strategies. For the multi-factor funds, FTSE Russell provides the index, but OppenheimerFunds provides some of the economic and risk data signals that go into the algorithm that drives the makeup of the benchmark. On the single-factor strategies, FTSE Russell came up with the methodology and administers the index alone.



Oppenheimer is â€œnot predisposedâ€ù to using third parties or running its own indexes, Mazza says. â€œWe have a build and buy mentality that we can benefit fromâ€_ based on what is going to be best for the investor at any given time.â€ù In some cases, it is more efficient and effective to use third parties to sponsor the indexes while, in other cases, protecting the proprietary research makes it â€œnecessaryâ€ù to self-index.



For example, OppenheimerFunds will continue to own and run the benchmark behind the Oppenheimer ESG Revenue ETF, but S&P will continue to act as the service provider responsible for calculating the benchmark.



Regulatory concerns for self-indexers are one of the â€œoperational aspectsâ€ù that go into deciding whether to go in-house or instead use a third-party to manage indexes, Mazza says. But regulatory concerns had a â€œminimalâ€ù impact on the revenue-weighted ETF changes, he notes.



VictoryShares, meanwhile, announced that Nasdaq would take on administration of its proprietary CEMP indexes, affecting 14 different equity ETFs that collectively represent more than $3.1 billion in assets. Nasdaq already calculates and publishes the indexes behind the VictoryShares Multi-Factor Minimum Volatility ETF and VictoryShares Dividend Growth ETF.



Officials say the move should â€œimprove client outcomesâ€ù by having a well-recognized index provider take on responsibility for the benchmarks. â€œNasdaq offers objectivity in the rules-based aspect of our products, and we are looking forward to the benefits the expanded partnership delivers for our clients,â€ù Mannik Dhillon, president of VictoryShares and solutions, said in a press release announcing the deal.



A spokeswoman from Victory declined to comment further.



VictoryShares is not the first ETF provider to hand off sponsorship of an index to Nasdaq. In 2016, First Trust announced its AlphaDEX smart-beta ETFs would stop tracking proprietary indexes and instead begin following new Nasdaq-sponsored ones that incorporated the same AlphaDEX selection criteria. Wheaton, Ill.-based First Trust licensed its patents and trademarks for the AlphaDEX brand and methodology to Nasdaq.



In both cases, the shops were looking for a strong partner to provide not only administration but also marketing, education and other support, says Dave Gedeon, head of index research and development at Nasdaq.

Coveted Nest Eggs

Using Retirement Insights to Shape Personalized Products and Advice Solutions

(June 19, 2018, Rye, NY) â€“ Surprises in retirement income sources range from oversized roles for

dividends and taxable brokerage to overly high expectations for retirement accounts in new findings

from Hearts & Wallets, the source for retail investor data and insights.

This analysis goes beyond national averages for a detailed look at retirement income sources of

current retirees and those anticipated by future retirees, expanding upon the new Hearts &

Wallets Retirement & Funding: Building Informed Expectations About Sources of Income in

Retirement insight module report. This report examines expectations of the yet-to-retire

consumer and current retiree realities. The data details consumer work plans and retirement

lifestyles, including anticipated and actual income replacement rates and sources of funding.

Also included are employer-sponsored plan data and metrics on retirement preparedness and

spending in retirement.

Written by Hearts & Wallets subject matter experts with decades of operating experience in retail

finance, consumer packaged goods and technology development, and acumen honed at the

nationâ€™s finest business schools, the report is drawn from the latest fielding of the Hearts & Wallets

Investor Quantitativeâ„¢ Database (IQâ„¢ Database). The IQâ„¢ Database is the largest single dataset

on U.S. retail consumer attitudes, behaviors and buying patterns with over 40,000 U.S. households.

Show Me the Income

Retirement funding sources are undergoing significant shifts as investable assets are anticipated

to more than double as an income source for future retirees with the significant decline of pensions

as a funding source for consumers under age 60. Most analyses look at income sources at the

national household level and highlight the important role that Social Security plays in delivering half

of current retiree income.

Going beyond national averages, an analysis can identify important specific streams of retirement

income by group. Nationally, dividends from stocks and mutual funds represent only 4% of

retirement income for all current retirees. The story is much different when focusing only on the

subset of retirees who have this particular source of income and excluding retirees without any

income from stocks and mutual funds. For retirees who have dividends, dividends represent

almost one-fifth of their income (19%) across all asset levels, and over one third (34%) of income

for retirees with $2 million and more in investable assets. Future retirees holding dividends

anticipate obtaining 16% of income from this source with the wealthiest future retirees saying it will

represent only about a quarter (27%) of their income.

Surprises in Retirement Income/2

The wide variance between national averages and specific groups who have these income

sources is also seen in taxable brokerage accounts. Nationally, taxable brokerage account

withdrawals represent only 2% of income for all retirees. Yet, for retirees who take withdrawals

from taxable brokerage accounts, this source jumps to 21% of income, 23% for retirees with

$500,000 to $2 million in investable assets, and 29% for retirees with over $2 million in

investable assets.

â€œDividends and taxable brokerage accounts are quiet sources of retiree income,â€ù Laura Varas,

CEO and founder of Hearts & Wallets, said. â€œRetirement account withdrawals, in contrast, have

gotten lots of attention with whole infrastructures built around them. Different sources of retirement

income are the threads that retirees weave together to form a protective blanket for their senior

years. Patterns vary greatly depending on the types and amounts of each thread used in the

individualâ€™s blanket. By studying actual retirees, we gain important insights into income sources for

specific groups that can shape personalized product and advice solutions going forward.â€ù

Big Dreams for Retirement Accounts

Withdrawals from retirement accounts, such as IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b) and 457 plans follow a

similar pattern for current retirees nationally and for people who hold these accounts. The main

difference is the significant expectations that future retirees have for tapping into such accounts.

Retirement account withdrawals are expected to be four times as large a source of income as

they are for todayâ€™s retirees, 16% vs. 4%. Twice as many future retirees think they will have

retirement account income as currently have such income among all retirees nationally.

Potential tax implications of retirement account withdrawals may not be reflected in the

consumerâ€™s expectations.

For retirees who have these accounts, retirement account withdrawals represent about 22% of

income, 24% for retirees with $500,000 to $2 million in investable assets, and 30% for retirees

with over $2 million.

Work and Retirement

Employment is an important source of income in retirement at the national level, representing 8%

of income for all current retirees or their spouses, representing about the same percentage for all

asset levels. Focusing specifically on retirees who have this income source, employment jumps

to 36% of their income.

For future retirees, employment is anticipated be a bigger piece of the retirement pie at 10%

nationally, and 13% for households with under $100,000 in investable assets. Focusing the lens

more narrowly on only future retirees who say they plan to work in retirement, this income source

represents 25% of income for all asset levels, 30% for households with under $100,000, 16% for

households with assets of $500,000 to $2 million, and 25% for households with $2 million plus.

-more-

Surprises in Retirement Income/3

Consumers with pensions seem to be the most predisposed to consider stopping full-time work.

Half (50%) of those with pensions that will represent 20% or more of their retirement income say

they want to â€œ'stop working/retire at a certain ageâ€ù as compared 32% of non-pensioners.

â€œConsumers may want to work longer as a retirement of 20, 30 or more years isnâ€™t necessarily

practical,â€ù Amber Katris, Hearts & Wallets Subject Matter Expert and report author, said. â€œThese

expectations must be tempered as work opportunities can run out for older consumers. Our

qualitative research also demonstrates age discrimination is very real. When older people can

continue to work, this income source is extremely important in retirement. Flexible, personalized

roadmaps can help consumers achieve their goals and build resiliency to cope with uncertainties.â€ù

Real Estate Resources

Real estate income is another source that appears insignificant (1%) at the national level for all

current retirees, and it is only 3% for all future retirees. But for current retirees who derive some

income from real estate this resource can be important, representing 22% of income for retirees

of all asset levels, 20% for retirees with less than $100,000 in investable assets, and 24% for

retirees with $500,000 to $2 million.

What Really Matters

â€œConsumers want to optimize their last chapter,â€ù Varas said. â€œThis report provides a roadmap to

help develop personalized advice and guidance that incorporates income sources, family

dynamics, work status and other factors to help consumers grapple with the ultimate uncertainty,

life expectancy, to gain the most joy out of their life by using their assets to achieve their goals.â€ù """,,6/19/18,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,57:13.7,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,57:13.7125,US Marijuana ETF Boom Stalls,http://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/us-marijuana-etf-boom-stalls?nopaging=1,Exchange Traded Products,ETF.com," ""

US Marijuana ETF Boom Stalls



June 26, 2018

Lara Crigger



The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) started off 2018 with a bang.



Fresh off a controversial index change at the end of 2017 that swapped its flagging Latin American real estate index for one that tracked legal cannabis companies, MJ attracted a whopping $401 million in new net inflows during the first two months of the year.



Excitement around the fund was high; in fact, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas even said that MJ was 'on pace to take in $1 billion' or more.



And then â€_ nothing.



Since March 1, MJâ€”now at $408 million in assets under managementâ€”has brought in just $14 million in new net inflows. In fact, the fund hasn't seen any net flows since June 12, shortly after President Trump announced he was likely to back legislative efforts to let states decide whether to legalize marijuana. Prior to June 11, MJ hadn't seen any new money since April.



Not even the Canadian Senate's vote on June 20 to officially legalize recreational marijuana nationwide moved the needle for MJ (56% of the ETF by weight is in Canadian-listed stocks). So where did all the excitement for marijuana ETFs go?



MJ's Performance Lags



MJ's lack of inflows isn't due to lack of investor interest in the space, as the fund consistently ranks among the top most-searched-for ETFs on our site (read: 'Most Searched ETFs On ETF.com').



Instead, MJ's lackluster performance is more likely to blame. Though MJ saw a performance spike shortly after it switched indexes on Dec. 26, 2017, mirroring a similar spike in marijuana stocks as a whole, the fund's returns ever since have been anemic. Year-to-date, MJ is down 2.25%:



 



 



(Longer-dated historical returns for MJ may look impressive, but keep in mind they are irrelevant. On a one-year basis, MJ is up 11.9%. That figure, however, includes returns from before MJ switched indexes.)



Dragged Down By Tobacco Stocks



At first, it may seem counterintuitive that MJ's year-to-date performance is so low, considering the marijuana sector has been buoyed by the Canadian legalization push. The North American Marijuana Index, which tracks cannabis companies in the U.S. and Canada, is up 19% over the past six months.



Individual marijuana companies have fared much better. For example, the stock prices of MJ's top three holdingsâ€”The Green Organic Dutchman, MedReleaf Corp. and Canopy Growth Corp.â€”have risen 77%, 35% and 41% year-to-date, respectively:



 



 



However, MJ's 22% weighting to tobacco stocksâ€”which many experts consider a forward-looking play on the cannabis spaceâ€”has likely dampened fund returns.



Performance of the tobacco sector is far more mixed. For example, the top three tobacco-related stocks in MJâ€”Turning Point Brands, 22nd Century Group and Philip Morrisâ€”are up 48%, down 14% and down 22% year-to-date, respectively:



 



Charts courtesy of StockCharts.com; data as of June 25, 2018



 



On the other hands, the AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), which tracks a mixed portfolio of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis stocks, has seen slightly better year-to-date performance: -0.72%. ACT's outperformance relative to MJ is likely due to the fact that ACT holds more than half its portfolio in alcohol stocks, such as Boston Beer Co., Constellation Brands and MGP Ingredients, which are up 58%, 0.35% and 22% year-to-date, respectively.



As for the rest of its holdings, ACT holds roughly 20% in marijuana companies and 26% in tobacco stocks. Investors have yet to respond to ACT's particular blend of 'vice' stocks, however: The $13 million ETF has brought in just $5.4 million in new money year-to-date.



Custodial Risk Still Hazy



Risk may also explain why investors have been avoiding marijuana ETFs, including custodial risk, which ETF.com has reported on in the past and which remains unresolved (read: 'Promise & Peril Of Marijuana ETFs').



Even though most marijuana stocks are domiciled in Canada, many U.S. custodian banks still refuse to take on the reputational, and possible legal, risk of holding stocks whose business remains federally illegal in the States, at least when doing so for an explicitly cannabis-themed fund. That could run them afoul of federal banking laws, risking the bank's FDIC insurance or even its license.



The two issuers with cannabis-themed ETFs approached this risk differently. ACT's issuer, AdvisorShares opted for nonpure-play cannabis exposure, working closely with its custodian to select only U.S.-listed marijuana securities that had been registered with the Drug Enforcement Agency.



Meanwhile MJ's issuer, ETF Managers Group, effectively circumvented its own custodian by swapping the benchmark for an existing fund, LARE, in favor of a marijuana index. The ETF was then relaunched as MJX, later renamed MJ (read: 'When An ETF Changes Its Exposure') .



It remains unclear whether the fund's custodian, U.S. Bank, plans to or has taken any action with ETF Managers Group over the index switch, which was done without its prior approval. As more time passes, however, the less likely it becomes that U.S. Bank will amend or terminate its relationship with MJ.



Indeed, the newest ETFMG fund, the Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF (BDRY), still lists U.S. Bank as custodian in the fund prospectus, underscoring the continuing relationship between the two entities.



US Regulatory Future Uncertain



The other big risk of marijuana ETFs is the persistent uncertain regulatory future for the underlying stocks.



In the U.S., public sentiment appears to be in favor of marijuana legalization, either federally or on a state-by-state basis. Lawmakers have introduced bills to legalize marijuana at the federal level in both chambers of Congress, while President Trump has indicated his preference to leave the question of legalization up to individual states.



Yet U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fiercely opposes legalization. In April, he rescinded Obama-era protections for marijuana companies that are legal on a state level. Sessions has also formed a task force to investigate the connection between marijuana and violent crimes.



With several states putting marijuana measures on the ballot this coming election season, the question of legality may come to a head this fall. If the question of legality finally gets resolved, though, it would profoundly impact marijuana stocks in the U.S. and abroad, and potentially open up an estimated multibillion-dollar market.



That could also eliminate the custodial risk associated with marijuana ETFs, thereby making it possible to launch new marijuana ETFs in the U.S. Many already-proposed funds have stalled before the SEC, and no new marijuana ETFs have been proposed this year.



Canadian Marijuana ETFs Boom



Meanwhile in Canada, Toronto-listed marijuana ETFs have boomed, particularly on the optimism generated in anticipation of and after the country's vote to legalize recreational marijuana. (June 20's vote was the last step in a multichamber process, and full legalization is set to take effect Oct. 17.)



The world's first marijuana ETF, the $868 million Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (TSE: HMMJ), is up 119% over the past 12 months, and has attracted more than $350 million in net inflows year-to-date.



Two additional Canadian marijuana ETFs were also introduced to market earlier this year: the $12 million Horizons Emerging Marijuana Growers Index ETF (CN: HMJR), which tracks junior North American pot growers; and the $5 million Evolve Marijuana ETF (TSE: SEED), an actively managed fund. (Performance data for HMJR and SEED are not available. Canada restricts the publication of those numbers until a fund has a one-year track record.)



Earlier this month, Horizons also filed for three leveraged marijuana ETFs offering -1x, 2x and -2x exposure to the daily returns of a benchmark tracking solely Canadian marijuana companies. Part of the rationale was to give investors more options to short marijuana stocks.



'We've noticed there is significant demand from investors to short marijuana stocks,' Steve Hawkins, president and co-CEO of Horizons ETFs told The Globe And Mail, adding that HMMJ has benefited from this demand by lending out its underlying securities and providing revenue for shareholders (read: 'Is Securities Lending Good For ETF Investors?').

Valued for their simplicity, exchange-traded funds pose worrying risks.

by Satyajit Das

Banks must bear much of the blame for previous financial crises. In the next one, ordinary investors could play a more central role.

Ironically, theyâ€™ll do so through vehicles created with them in mind â€“ exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. These listed funds are passive by nature, designed to track the performance of an index of stocks, bonds, currencies or commodities rather than to pick and choose among individual companies.

The popularity of ETFs has soared in the past decade. The proportion of U.S. equity-fund assets that are passively managed has nearly doubled in that time to nearly 40 percent. Vanguard alone owns positions greater than 5 percent in 491 of the stocks on the S&P 500, adding up to nearly 7 percent of the indexâ€™s total market cap. In Japan, where the central bank owns big stakes in ETFs, passive investors hold over half of all equity assets.

Itâ€™s easy to see why such funds have thrived. ETFs, invested in indices that are theoretically diversified, have consistently outperformed active managers. Their simplicity is appealing to lay investors, who can focus on broad asset-allocation strategies rather than guessing at individual winners and losers. Costs are low, with fees typically running between 0.05 percent and 0.50 percent. Thatâ€™s become even more important as returns broadly have declined.

ETFs, however, are riskier than many investors appreciate. With cap-weighted indices, for instance, funds have no choice but to load up on stocks that are already overweight (and often pricey) and neglect those already underweight. As prices have risen, investors may become overexposed to a few large securities, such as the big tech companies which now dominate major U.S. indices. Thatâ€™s the opposite of â€œbuy low, sell high.â€ù

ETFs can replicate indices in complicated ways. Rather than purchasing all the assets consistent with index weights, some funds use a sub-set, thus exposing investors to tracking error. Others use derivatives, creating credit exposure to the counterparty. Some ETFs use leverage to enhance returns. Like other funds, ETFs can lend out the fundâ€™s securities to short-sellers, which creates exposure to the return of the borrowed assets. ETFs must be fully invested and therefore hold minimal cash, which could limit flexibility in a downturn. The rules governing indices can be changed, sometimes arbitrarily.

Worse, the ways in which ETFs â€“ by their design and their sheer size â€“ are warping markets arenâ€™t well-understood. ETFs encourage concentration in a few, liquid, large-cap stocks, creating homogenous and momentum-following markets. The focus on driving down costs requires ETFs to emphasize scale, further exacerbating concentration. Markets become susceptible to flows from a few, large, passive products.

Artificial factors, such as inclusion or exclusion from an index, forces buying and selling; this can lead to misallocations of capital. In the current equity cycle, for instance, over-weighted, liquid, large-cap stocks have benefited disproportionately from forced buying. This increases the risk of bubbles, as in 2000.

ETFs may even distort valuations outright. For one thing, they donâ€™t analyze prices, meaning that they donâ€™t contribute to price discovery. They arguably weaken corporate activism, as passive owners have little interest in corporate governance.

Finally, ETFs increase volatility and shrink liquidity. Passive funds exhibit significantly higher intraday and daily volatility, driven by arbitrage activity between ETFs and the underlying stocks. With ETFs increasingly important as the marginal buyers and sellers of securities, this may increase volatility in periods of instability.

At the same time, passive funds lock up a large percentage of stocks that can only be traded on changes in market capitalization or other index metrics. Thus, the actual number of shares available to trade -- or â€œtrue floatâ€ù -- may be a lot smaller than investors realize. Especially when dealing with small-cap shares, certain bonds and commodities, many ETFs are predicated on greater liquidity than is actually available in the underlying assets.

If a crisis does arise, this is likely to exacerbate the downturn. ETFs will have to sell quickly what theyâ€™ve disproportionately bought; passive indexers may become panic sellers. Where ETFs have been the primary buyers, they may have trouble finding anyone willing to purchase the holdings theyâ€™re trying to liquidate.

Imagine that one big investor in an ETF with, say, a 10 percent stake is forced to sell a large part its holding in a single day. There might not be ready buyers for such a large holding, causing the ETF to fall to a price below the value of the assets it owns. This price impact may be exaggerated, as ETF activity intensifies both upswings and downswings. Crashes, when they happen, may be bigger.

The good times, driven by a confluence of policies favoring passive strategies, have been very good to ETFs. What investors should be worrying about now is how resilient theyâ€™ll be when conditions change. In every crisis, untested structures have revealed hidden weaknesses which have threatened wealth and financial stability. Thereâ€™s no reason to think next time will be any different.

Structured whatsits.

The way a lot of bank structured notes work is that you give the bank $100, and in a few years, if the S&P 500 index or whatever is up, the bank gives you back more than $100, based on some multiple of the indexâ€™s performance. If the index is down, though, the bank gives you back your $100. Heads you win, tails you donâ€™t lose: You get a guaranteed return of your principal plus some extra money if the stock market does well. The bank has sold you a bond (or a certificate of deposit), and instead of paying you interest on that bond, it uses the interest to buy an option on the S&P 500 or whatever. You get the combination of (1) a bond that doesnâ€™t pay interest and (2) a â€œfreeâ€ù option.

This product is built to be extremely attractive for the bank: The amount it saves in interest is significantly more than the option is worthâ€”often by $2 or $3 in a $100 structured noteâ€”and it also charges you a hefty commission (perhaps another $3) for buying it. (The bank normally hedges the option and so doesnâ€™t actually care if the market goes up or down.) 

But it is also built to look extremely attractive for you. Anyone could sell this stuff. If you donâ€™t think too hard about it, it looks like magic: The bank offers you the opportunity to participate in the stock market if it goes up, but with no risk of losing your money. Whatâ€™s not to like? Donâ€™t answer â€œyou could construct this yourself by buying bonds and options, or even bonds and stocks, and save the huge markupsâ€ù; that is of course correct, but the whole point of the product is that it is sold to people who donâ€™t say that. 

A lot of people really dislike structured notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission â€œhas been focusing on the products, which have been criticized for their high fees and lack of transparency.â€ù There is a widespread sense that structured notes are fundamentally a trick. But they are a subtle kind of trick. You donâ€™t have to lie to sell them. You just have to describe them accurately, explain how the investor does well in every scenario, not emphasize the fees too much, and pitch them to investors in the sweet spot of sophistication: sophisticated enough to like structure and complication and the notion of â€œyou will do well in every scenario,â€ù but not so sophisticated that they ask questions like â€œwell wouldnâ€™t I do better in this scenario if I just bought stockâ€ù or â€œwell what if I just bought the options myself instead?â€ù The trick is not deception; the trick is in understanding what payoff curves look attractive and then designing a product with those curves, in using derivatives to tell a story that is based in fact but so enthralling that customers cannot resist. The trick is building a thing that makes customers feel smart, rather than worrying about whether the thing is smart. 

Yesterday Wells Fargo Advisors LLC agreed to pay $4.1 million to settle SEC charges relating to its structured notes business. The problem was not that it sold the structured notes, which often had â€œa selling commission of up to 3% paid to WFA, plus 2% to 3% of structuring and hedging costs received by WFA affiliates,â€ù meaning that â€œa customer who purchased an MLI at a $100 par value would receive an MLI with a value between $94 and $95 as of the day of purchase.â€ù (â€œMLI,â€ù for â€œmarket-linked investment,â€ù is one of many terms used to describe structured notes.)

Instead, the problem is that once Wells Fargo had sold the notes, it didnâ€™t want to leave well enough alone, and some of its advisors would push structured-notes investors to trade them in for new and improved structured notes.

Here is the pitch for that. If you bought a $100 structured note, and the S&P 500 index went up over the next year, your structured note might now be worth $110. Of that $110, $100 is guaranteed: Youâ€™ll always get back, at maturity, at least as much as you put in. But the other $10 is still at risk: If the stock market goes back down, you might only end up with $100.

So your Wells Fargo broker would come to you and say: Look, why not take some risk off the table? Trade in your old $100 structured note, which is worth $110, for $110 face amount of new structured notes. The new ones are a lot like the old ones except that theyâ€™re based on todayâ€™s market price, meaning that if the market goes down you are guaranteed to get back your $110, not just the old $100.

Certain WFA representatives frequently justified the MLI exchanges by claiming that customers were â€œlocking in gainsâ€ù on their original MLI investments. The rationale behind soliciting customers to redeem early was that customers could capture their gains to date (or most of their gains when considering the markdown) rather than risk a decline in the performance of the reference asset that could result in the customer receiving less at maturity. Certain WFA representatives further solicited customers to invest the early redemption proceeds in a new MLI that would have a higher principal amount that was either fully or partially protected. Certain WFA representatives had great success selling customers on a â€œlock in gainsâ€ù strategy, as it appealed to customersâ€™ desire to protect their principal and avoid loss of gains in a market downturn.

That is a good pitch. The customer bought the structured note to get stock upside plus safety; this is a way to go back and appeal to those desires again. There is only one catch, which is that Wells Fargo is going to eat up most of your money in fees, markups and markdowns if you do this:

By way of illustration, if a customer makes a $100 par value investment in an MLI, it would be worth $95 on the date of purchase after taking into account the markup by WFAâ€™s affiliate. If the reference asset appreciates significantly, it may correspond to an increase in the value of the MLI from $95 to $110. If WFA were to solicit its customer to engage in an MLI exchange at this point, a WFA affiliate would typically repurchase the investment from the customer at approximately $108 after a 2% markdown, resulting in a realized profit of 8%. If the customer then reinvests the $108 proceeds into a new MLI, the new MLI would be worth approximately 95% of par on the purchase date after costs, or $102.60. The customer exchanges an MLI valued at $110 for a similar product valued at $102.60, and more than 80% of the original MLIâ€™s growth in value is consumed by transaction costs. If a customer regularly makes such exchanges, the customer is left with minimal long-term returns net of the significant costs.

One customer paid $900,000 in commissions and markups to flip 110 structured notes from 2009 through 2012, while making $300,000 in investment returns. (That worked out to a 1.5 percent annualized yield, which actually â€_ wasnâ€™t bad for insured certificate of deposits in 2009 through 2012?)

Anyway you are not supposed to do this, I guess; Wells Fargo settled without admitting or denying the charges, and the problem seems to be that the brokers â€œdid not fully understand all of the costs associated with MLI exchanges,â€ù and â€œnever evaluated the effect such costs would have on customersâ€™ ability to achieve their investment objectives.â€ù

â€œIt is important that brokers do their homework before they recommend that their retail customers buy or sell complex structured products,â€ù says the SEC. Ehh. I am happy to believe that the brokers didnâ€™t understand what they were selling, but I also tend to think that if they had understood it, some of them would have sold it anyway. It made them a lot of money! And the pitch to investors was so appealingâ€”without being quite rightâ€”but also without being quite misleading. Nothing here is all that much worse than selling the structured notes in the first place; the flipping pitch is just a concentrated essence of the regular structured-notes pitch.

SRP News

Wells Fargo Advisors (WFA) has agreed to settle charges of misconduct in the sale of financial products known as market-linked investments (MLIs) to retail investors, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said today.

According to the US watchdog, Wells Fargo generated large fees by 'improperly encouraging retail customers to actively trade the products', which were intended to be held to maturity. As described in the SEC's order, the trading strategy - which involved selling the MLIs before maturity and investing the proceeds in new MLIs - generated substantial fees for Wells Fargo, which reduced the customers' investment returns.

According to the SEC, WFA began offering two types of MLIs to its customers in 2002 including market-linked certificates of deposit (MLCDs) and market-linked notes (MLNs). According to WFA product disclosures, the MLCDs sold by WFA were structured investments issued by WFB or in some cases a third-party issuer. WFA product disclosures also showed that MLIs were not suitable for short-term trading due to their limited liquidity while purchasers of MLIs should be buy-and-hold investors and that the products were generally suitable only for customers who were able to hold the investments until maturity.

SRP data shows that Wells Fargo is a top ten provider in the US market with over US$1.2bn in sales in 2017 across 317 structured products of which 46 were MLCDs and 271 were MLNs. Year to date, the firm has marketed 144 products worth US$498m.

The order also found that the Wells Fargo sales representatives involved did not 'reasonably investigate or understand the significant costs of the recommendations' while the firm's Wells Fargo supervisors routinely approved these transactions despite internal policies prohibiting short-term trading or 'flipping' of the products.

'It is important that brokers do their homework before they recommend that their retail customers buy or sell complex structured products,' said Daniel Michael, chief of the enforcement division's complex financial instruments unit.

Michael also said that the products sold by Wells Fargo came with high fees and commissions, 'which Wells Fargo should have taken into account before advising retail customers to sell their investments and reinvest the proceeds in similar products'.

The regulator also found that prior to the integration of Wells Fargo Investments (WFI) and Wachovia in January 2011, WFI did not have a written policy expressly prohibiting or discouraging the practice of soliciting early liquidations of MLIs or MLI exchanges. 'However, as early as 2005, WFI compliance personnel were aware of the practice and took steps to curb the solicitation of early liquidations,' stated the regulator. 'Despite the implementation of the pre-approval process for early liquidations in 2009, certain WFI representatives continued to engage in MLI exchanges without meaningful supervision or guidance.'

Without admitting or denying the findings of the regulator, Wells Fargo agreed to return US$930,377 of ill-gotten gains plus US$178,064 of interest and to pay a US$4m penalty.  Wells Fargo also agreed to a 'censure and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws'. The SEC acknowledged recognizes that Wells Fargo took remedial steps to address the allegedly improper sales practices.

LAURA NOONAN â€” LONDON

Commerzbank is experimenting with artificial intelligence technology that automatically generates sports reports to see if it can write basic analystsâ€™ research notes, as new regulations force banks across the world to trim research costs.

The German bank is working on the project with Retresco, a content automation company in which it invested two years ago through its fintech incubator unit.

The project is at an early stage and could take years to produce reports that banks would be happy to send to their clients, but the notion of AI replacing human analysts is already attracting attention from senior bankers.

â€œThereâ€™s definitely work that can be done, parts of the [research] process that can be enhanced by algos and AI tools,â€ù the head of one investment bank told the Financial Times, describing earnings reports as something that â€œshould be robo-writtenâ€ù.

The Europe head of another investment bank said that research was an area that was rife for automation, while analysts at several other banks said that their managers were experimenting with AI and automation applications.

Banks are under fierce pressure to cut the costs of producing research on stocks and bonds following the implementation in January of European investor protections known as Mifid II.

The measures force investors to pay for research explicitly instead of bundling its costs into trading commissions. Some firms say their implied research revenue has fallen by as much as 30 per cent as a result.

Equity research on companiesâ€™ earnings is one of the areas that Retresco and Commerzbank have been focusing on after they analysed the bankâ€™s warehouse of research reports and the data behind them.

Michael Spitz, head of Commerzbankâ€™s research and development unit Mainincubator, said the area showed promise because â€œequity research reports reviewing quarterly earnings are structured in similar waysâ€ù and the source documents are often prepared under common reporting standards.

That makes it easier for a machine learning programme to extract and contextualise relevant data, which can be then framed in a report using natural language processing tools.

Commerzbank Replacing Human Research Analysts With Artificial Intelligence 

 

by Tyler Durden 

Tue, 06/26/2018 - 04:15 

Commerzbank is hoping that computers will soon be able to do at least as good a job writing its equity research reports as the armies of junior analysts that the big banks are no doubt looking to trim thanks to expensive MifidII regulations and restrictions that have cut funding costs for research departments.

Even as its captured the attention of bank executives, automated and computerized equity analysis has, for the most part, been a disaster over the last couple of years. While some larger firms may use algorithms and some automation to crank out macro economic reports, and while computers may be getting better at scraping and reporting data (without actually analyzing it), performing equity analysis requires a deeper look behind the numbers and its simply not a task optimized for automation.

However, we are apparently at that stage in the cycle where cutting costs becomes far more important then being productive or effective, particularly since MiFid II is forcing a race to bottom as investment banks seek out deep cuts in their research departments, driven by a drop in revenue that has accompanied being forced to charge a separate, optional, rate for research instead of bundling those costs with trading fees.

One of these competitors, Germany's second largest bank has decided that the time has come to automate some of its equity analysis, and according to the Financial Times 'Commerzbank is experimenting with artificial intelligence technology that automatically generates sports reports to see if it can write basic analyst notes, as Mifid II forces banks across the world to trim research costs.'

The German bank is working on the project with Retresco, a content automation company in which it invested two years ago through its fintech incubator unit. The project is still at an early stage and could take years to produce reports that banks would be happy to send to their clients, but the notion of AI replacing human research analysts is already attracting attention from senior bankers.

'Thereâ€™s definitely work that can be done, parts of the [research] process that can be enhanced by algos and AI tools,' the head of one investment bank told the Financial Times, describing earnings reports as something that 'should be robo-written.'

Research into AI and automation solutions that can lessen the burden of data-intensive research will likely soon be a theme across the big banks, as they scramble to reduce one of their biggest cost-centers in a time of declining revenues.

The Europe head of another investment bank said research was an area that was rife for automation over time, while analysts at several other banks said their managers were experimenting with AI and automation applications. 



Banks are under fierce pressure to cut the costs of producing research on stocks and bonds following the implementation in January of European investor protections known as Mifid II. The measures force investors to pay for research explicitly instead of bundling its costs into trading commissions. Some firms say their implied research revenue has fallen by as much as 30 per cent as a result.

Possibly ignoring the fact that almost everybody (in the U.S.) reports in Non-GAAP numbers now and that any and all addbacks to earnings generally need to be looked at and analyzed on their own, a Commerzbank executive is confident that the venture would ultimately be successful.

Michael Spitz, head of Commerzbankâ€™s R&D unit, Mainincubator, said the area showed promise because â€œequity research reports reviewing quarterly earnings are structured in similar waysâ€ù and the source documents are often prepared under common reporting standards. 'That makes it easier for a machine learning program to extract and contextualise relevant data, which can be then framed in a report using natural language processing tools.' Retrescoâ€™s original business uses similar technology to write soccer reports in Germany, in other words if it works for sports it should work for the market.

Mr Spitz said the technology was already advanced enough to provide around 75 per cent of what a human equity analyst would when writing an immediate report on quarterly earnings. â€œIf it is related to much more abstract cases, we feel that we are not there yet â€” that we can or maybe will ever replace the quality of a researcher,â€ù he added. Bankers say regulatory demands for oversight on research publication could also protect humans in research jobs.

Recall, it was less than a year ago that we wrote about the first AI-controlled ETF. At the time, its creators said it 'has the ability to mimic an army of equity research analysts working around the clock, 365 days a year, while removing human error and bias from the process.'

Last year, EquBot LLC, in partnership with ETF Managers Group (ETFMG) launched the worldâ€™s first ETF powered by artificial intelligence, the AI Powered Equity ETF (NYSE Arca: AIEQ). According to Business Wire, the new ETF uses 'cognitive and big data processing abilities of IBM Watsonâ„¢ to analyze U.S.-listed investment opportunities.'

Business Wire explained how EquBot makes investment decisions 'EquBotâ€™s approach ranks investment opportunities based on their probability of benefiting from current economic conditions, trends, and world- and company-specific events, and identifies those equities with the greatest potential for appreciation. EquBot and ETFMG expect the fundâ€™s portfolio to typically consist of 30 to 70 of U.S. equities only and volatility comparable to the broader U.S. equity marketâ€_the fundâ€™s underlying technology is constantly analyzing information for approximately 6,000 U.S.-listed equities, including company management and market sentiment, and processes more than one million regulatory filings, quarterly results releases, news articles, and social media posts every day.â€ù

The moving of all financial services - including equity analysis - into AI, feels like it could become a major error not only as real human analysts will possibly be needed to reverse work that computers will likely do poorly, at least at first.  

A bigger problem is that this 'revolution' will come just as the paradigm that has defined markets for the past decade: central bank largesse pushing risk assets higher, fades, and neither AI nor unmanned algos will be able to trade in the 'newer normal.' Ironically this is precisely the time when humans will be most needed.

But that bridge has yet to be crossed, and until then the main prerogative is to keep costs low.

With that said, it seems unlikely that any bank has the artificial intelligence or automation on the level necessary to effectively dissect the story and the narrative that are behind the numbers yet. Consider every time trading algorithms have misinterpreted a headline, only to be kneejerked back and forth until human traders intervene to 'discover' the price.

For banks looking for a quick revenue saver, this option will almost certainly prove to be more trouble than it's worth.

Ex-bankers from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan hang out shingles to advise companies on securities offerings 

By Maureen Farrell and Liz Hoffman 

June 25, 2018 7:00 a.m. ET 

7 COMMENTS 

When Twitter Inc. was looking to raise $1 billion from investors earlier this month, it put out the usual calls to Wall Street banks.

The social-media company also called Vijay Culas, who works out of rented office space on a busy stretch of highway in San Mateo, Calif.

A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who hung out a shingle in 2014, Mr. Culas helped Twitter negotiate with its banks and ultimately sell a type of hybrid bond for a 1% fee, one of the cheapest offerings in recent memory.

Mr. Culas is among a handful of upstart advisers who are challenging investment banks on turf once thought impenetrable: the $7 billion-a-year business of handling complex stock-related transactions.

 

Jason Wood, who spent nine years at JPMorgan Chase & Co., went solo in 2013. A year later, Mr. Culas launched Matthews South, named for his Harvard University dorm. 

The accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP hired David Brown, an ex- Barclays PLC banker, in 2015 to advise their clients on capital-markets deals.

Without underwriting or trading arms, these advisers say they can give unbiased judgment and help clients wrangle a horde of hungry bankers. Their pitch is resonating, especially in Silicon Valley, where finance departments tend to be less robust and more suspicious of Wall Street.

All told, Messrs. Wood and Culas have worked on one-third of the roughly 30 convertible bond sales by U.S.-listed tech companies this year, including offerings by Square Inc., Etsy Inc. and Twilio Inc., according to people familiar with the deals.

Their success is the latest sign that Wall Streetâ€™s moat is shallower than it used to be. Investment banks were once one-stop shops, controlling each step of a big securities offering. Now they look vulnerable to the same unbundling that has hit cable television, challenged by a growing number of a la carte in-home entertainment options. 

Cheaper computing power and reams of market data allow solo bankers to compete with big banks. Mr. Wood, who works out of his Bay Area house, and Mr. Culas have about a dozen employees between them.

The two men want the high-touch business of advising on deals, leaving to big banks the laborious, risky task of executing them. They arm clients with data about comparable transactions and often run auctions to solicit banksâ€™ lowest bids.

â€œItâ€™s changing the dynamics of the transaction completely,â€ù said Thad Trent, the chief financial officer of Cypress Semiconductor Corp., a San Jose, Calif. chip maker that hired Mr. Culasâ€™s firm last November for a deal. â€œIt was the first time I felt like I had a level playing field with the banks.â€ù

Convertible bonds account for a small slice of investment-banking fees, which hit $38 billion last year, according to Dealogic. These hybrid instruments pay regular coupons like a bond, but in exchange for a lower interest rateâ€”at or near zero these daysâ€”investors can swap them for shares if the stock hits a predetermined price.

It is the sort of business once thought to be out of reach for startups, which lack balance sheets to underwrite securities and investor networks to sell them to.

Bankers say their trading and lending operations enable them to offer broader services and better market intelligence about how deals will play out in the market. Privately, they have urged lawyers and other advisers not to work with independent advisers or risk losing business from their banks, according to people familiar with the matter. They have warned clients that independent advisers get hired by promising unrealistic terms that investors wonâ€™t swallow.

Bankers pointed to Alteryx Inc.â€™s recent sale of $200 million of convertible bonds, when investors balked at aggressive terms negotiated by Mr. Culas. JPMorgan and Goldman were forced to discount the bonds, people familiar with the matter said, a chaotic offering that sparked selloff in Alteryxâ€™s shares and further reduced the value of the convertible bond.

â€œAs a new issuer [of convertible bonds], we felt it would be beneficial to seek independent guidance,â€ù a spokeswoman for Alteryx said. â€œShares reacted more negatively than expected but have since recovered, and we were very happy with the advice we received.â€ù

Capital-markets bankers are already feeling pinched. Companies are staying private longer, delaying the initial public offerings that generate big underwriting fees for banks. Competition has driven down fees on big trades and secondary offerings. Banksâ€™ revenue from U.S. stock offerings and related deals has fallen 38% since 2000, according to Dealogic.

A bright spot this year is convertible bonds like those sold by Twitter. Seventy-six companies have sold $27 billion worth this year, the most since 2008, according to Dealogic. More than half of this volume comes from Silicon Valley and other tech companies looking to capitalize on investor enthusiasm for their shares. 

The instruments come in nearly infinite flavors, with different coupons and conversion triggers. Historically, that complexity has worked in favor of banks, which make money underwriting the bonds and providing an accompanying derivative.

â€œThe most important service we provide is information,â€ù said Mr. Wood, who said clients often feel overwhelmed. â€œThere are dozens of decision points. We help educate them on the pros and cons.â€ù

Mr. Wood said he spent two years working with software company RingCentral Inc. before it issued a $400 million convertible bond in Marchâ€”paying 0% interest. He also advised Okta , Inc., Twilio and Zendesk Inc. on recent offerings, while Mr. Culas worked for Square and Etsy, among others.

Some banks are trying to get ahead of the trend. Goldman last year launched an app, called Athena, that allows corporate executives to design their own share repurchases. CFOs can customize deals with their preferred featuresâ€”and, Goldman hopes, call the bank to execute it.

The firm notified brokers that new clients can choose whether or not to allow advisers to take their information with them if they leave the firm

Jun 25, 2018 @ 10:39 am By Bruce Kelly 

A Wells Fargo Advisors memo Monday morning about client privacy policies sent a spasm of confusion across the network of 14,399 brokers and advisers, with one side saying that the memo undermined the firm's commitment to the protocol for broker recruiting and the other claiming Wells remains committed to the agreement. 

Some in the industry, citing a large number of advisers leaving the firm over the past couple years, have been anticipating that Wells Fargo Advisors will dump the protocol for broker recruiting. The agreement makes it easier for an adviser to carry valuable private client information when he changes jobs. 

Monday morning's update about the firm's client privacy policy, which was sent to brokers and advisers, added to that uncertainty for some. 

In the memo, Wells Fargo said that starting this week, clients with new accounts can choose whether to allow advisers to take their contact information with them if they leave the firm. 

Advisers' ability to carry a limited amount of confidential client information with them to a new firm without being sued is the crux of the broker protocol agreement, which was created in 2004 by a handful of large firms with the intention of limiting lawsuits. 

New Wells Fargo clients who want to opt out of brokers taking their information can inform the firm by calling a toll-free number, and advisers and their assistants cannot make that call. 

'The protocol issue was hidden this morning in the privacy update memo,' said one Wells Fargo adviser, who asked not to be named. 'They try to hide it to avoid the uproar and need to modify policies.' 

A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Advisors, Shea Leordeanu, said some people inside the firm had misunderstood the policy change. Because Wells Fargo had added a toll-free number for clients to call, it was required by regulations to send the memo. 

'We are not rethinking whether we are staying in the protocol,' said Ms. Leordeanu. 'We are staying in the protocol.' 

Morgan Stanley left the broker recruiting agreement at the end of last October and was soon followed by UBS Wealth Management Americas, creating confusion and anxiety among some advisers at the other large firms.

12 hours ago 

By: Jemima Kelly

Stanford economist John Taylor, a former Republican Treasury official and once a favourite to succeed Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve, is probably best-known for the â€œTaylor ruleâ€ù. This is essentially a guideline for how much central banks should adjust interest rates in response to changes in economic conditions, which suggests monetary policy should be more systematic, and less sensitive to politics and other outside pressures.

But now, Mr Taylor has got into crypto. Sigh. Yawn. Oh gosh not another one, etc. 

No but wait! This isn't the lambo-flaunting, money-stealing, nose-diving kind of crypto you might be used to. This is stable crypto. 

Stablecoins are a fast-emerging part of the fast-emerging world of cryptocurrency. If normal crypto is fist-pumping electronic music, these coins are slow radio. Their basic premise is that although cryptocurrencies are too volatile to be used as currency, they do have some potential advantages like fast international transfers, being available to anyone with an internet connection, and providing an alternative to people in countries like Venezuela, whose own currencies are being eroded away by runaway inflation. So rather than floating freely on the market and being subject to the wild price swings of other cryptos, stablecoins are pegged to a stable central-bank-issued currency -- the dollar, usually. 

Some stablecoins, like the â€œUSD Coinâ€ù that crypto firm Circle will be launching soon, say they are backed one-for-one by the mighty US dollar. The most famous of these is Tether, though many worry that it does not have the dollars it says it does and that Tethers are instead being produced out of thin air and pumped into the system to prop up the prices of other cryptocurrencies. (Tether produced a lawyer's report last week to prove they did have the dollars to back the Tethers, but seeing as this wasn't actually an audit -- it was an â€œaccount snapshotâ€ù -- and it wasn't even done by accountants, many people were not convinced.)

Basis, however, does not claim to have any such reserves, despite receiving $133m in investment from a bunch of big name VC investors such as Bain Capital Ventures and Andreesen Horowitz. Instead Basis, â€œa stable cryptocurrency with an algorithmic central bankâ€ù, uses a complex market mechanism borrowed from traditional financial markets to ensure stability. That, in turn, is what gives it its value, we are told. 

Basis founder Nader al-Naji, a Princeton graduate and former software engineer at Google, told us:

At a high level, by marrying traditional monetary theory with cryptocurrency, Basis is trying to deliver all the benefits of crypto but without the volatility. 

The website is all simplicity and light (a contrast to the garish colours, celebrity endorsements and hyperbole that the SEC parodied in truly exemplary fashion last month):

 

Here's a bit more explanation, from the Basis white paper:

While much cryptocurrency research has been dedicated to technical topics such as transaction throughput and smart contracts, almost no attention in comparison has been paid to improving price stability, a problem we believe to be a much bigger obstacle to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. 



...The Basis protocol accomplishes this by algorithmically adjusting the supply of Basis tokens in response to changes in, for example, the Basis-USD exchange rate. This implements a monetary policy similar to that executed by central banks around the world, except it operates as a decentralized, protocol-enforced algorithm, without the need for direct human judgment. For this reason, Basis can be understood as implementing an algorithmic central bank. 

By this stage, it should have become clearer why Mr Taylor, advocate of rules-based monetary policy and critic of unconventional policy such as quantitative easing, became an adviser to the project. 

Mr Taylor told us (emphasis ours): 

I do think that monetary policy has not always been very successful. To some extent this is because people have not always made the adjustments in time â€” there are political pressures, or theyâ€™ve delayed it, or somethingâ€™s prevented the central bank from moving. This [Basis] is a great improvement on that. 



The stability is so important - thatâ€™s whatâ€™s so, just, beautiful, and intriguing about this currency. It will get that stability, and itâ€™s really what weâ€™ve been searching for forever â€” to have a stable, reliable medium of exchange.

It all sounds quite, well, beautiful, right? And what is it backed by, again? Mr Taylor, again:

Itâ€™s not backed by anything other than the fact this is stable.



Wow, OK. But let's look at how it actually intends to work. Because it is not backed by dollars, the way Basis plans to maintain its stability is by executing open market operations. In other contexts, that means the buying and selling of securities in the open market, in order to produce an expansion or contraction of the amount of money in the system. In Basis's case, it means an algorithm buys and sells what it calls â€œBasis bondsâ€ù -- on the blockchain of course -- in response to changes in demand. 

Here's Mr al-Naji:

When the price is below a dollar, the protocol automatically automatically sells the â€œbond tokenâ€ù on the blockchain for Basis. So the bond tokens go into circulation and Basis goes out of circulation, and thatâ€™s how the supply of Basis contracts. Itâ€™s almost exactly like an open-market operation from a central bank. 

Mr al-Naji says there's an incentive to become involved in the market because of the arbitrage opportunity: 

It allows people to essentially buy a bond for less than par value, which is what traditional monetary system does... When Basis is selling these bond tokens, their par value is 1 because they (the bondholders) are eventually going to get paid back one full Basis. But the market participants can buy them for less than one full Basis. That effectively contracts the supply and provides an incentive for people to buy Basis on the market.

Basis is trying to create promises to pay, just like banks do. But the difference is Basis is doing this without anything to guarantee those promises like, say, the balance-sheet of a sovereign state. 

University of the West of England macro-finance professor Daniela Gabor, whose work focuses on shadow ba7nking and transnational banking, told us the following: 

The moneyness of a bank deposit means I can go to my bank any time and say that for every pound Iâ€™ve put in there you have to give me back a pound of cash... (but) Basis is creating promises to pay out of nothing. The question is: why would these promises to pay have moneyness? Why would I trust them that whatever I want to switch back into state money, I can? 

...What the bond token is doing is transferring the responsibility of par convertibility - itâ€™s kicking it down the line - onto the bondholder in that process. 

Nicholas Weaver, Berkeley computer science professor and blockchain critic pointed out to us that there didn't seem to be much thought given to the security of the system -- blockchain-based systems, like any internet-based computer systems, are prone to attack: 

It reads like classic computer programming utopian nonsense. It waves away the notion of attacks on the system from an economic perspective.

He also pointed out that it was going to be tricky for Basis to try to convince the SEC that â€œBasis bond tokensâ€ù were not securities. 

On that, Basis told us:

We haven't yet publicised our regulatory approach but we are working with reputable external and internal counsel to do the regulatory analysis and stay on top of any developments so that we can design Basis to be both compliant and able to achieve its mission.

Hmm. OK. And what about making some money for Basis's investors, we ask? Mr al-Naji, again:

It's very important to us that we comply with regulatory requirements so I'd avoid focusing on the commercial aspects of Basis. But as a general answer, our design goal is to have participants in the system share in expansions of Basis supply when the Blockchain decides an expansion of supply is needed. You can check out the White Paper on our website for more information on this design as well.

Ah, sorry, OK, let's not focus on the commercial aspects of a currency that's received $133m in investment before it's even launched. We'll check out the white paper.

The bill raced through the State Legislature without opposition on Thursday and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, just hours before a deadline to pull from the November ballot an initiative seeking even tougher oversight over technology companies.



The new law grants consumers the right to know what information companies are collecting about them, why they are collecting that data and with whom they are sharing it. It gives consumers the right to tell companies to delete their information as well as to not sell or share their data. Businesses must still give consumers who opt out the same quality of service.



It also makes it more difficult to share or sell data on children younger than 16.



The legislation, which goes into effect in January 2020, makes it easier for consumers to sue companies after a data breach. And it gives the stateâ€™s attorney general more authority to fine companies that donâ€™t adhere to the new regulations.

The California law is not as expansive as Europeâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., a new set of laws restricting how tech companies collect, store and use personal data.



But Aleecia M. McDonald, an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in privacy policy, said Californiaâ€™s privacy measure was one of the most comprehensive in the United States, since most existing laws â€” and there are not many â€” do little to limit what companies can do with consumer information.



â€œItâ€™s a step forward, and it should be appreciated as a step forward when itâ€™s been a long time since there were any steps,â€ù Ms. McDonald said.



The legislation is modeled closely on the ballot initiative, which a real estate developer, Alastair Mactaggart, spent $3 million and secured more than 600,000 signatures to get certified. With the ballot proposal hanging over legislatorsâ€™ heads, the push for an alternative gained grudging support.



If the bill had failed to pass before the deadline, the proponents of the ballot initiative would have taken their case straight to voters in November, they said.

The stateâ€™s technology and business lobbies were opposed to the measure that was passed on Thursday, but they didnâ€™t try to derail it because they thought the ballot initiative was worse.



Even legislators who voted for the bill complained that they had little choice because a ballot measure would provide less flexibility to make changes in the future. And some privacy advocates said the bill did not go as far as the ballot initiative in allowing individuals to sue for not complying.

Mr. Mactaggart said he wanted a sensible privacy law, whether through a ballot measure or the legislative process. He said that the Legislature was the right place to debate such a policy, but that it had been hard to get legislators to address privacy.



â€œIf we didnâ€™t have the initiative process in California, we wouldnâ€™t be here today,â€ù Mr. Mactaggart said in an interview.



One of the authors of the new law, Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat, tried last year to pass a bill that would have required internet service providers to seek permission from customers before accessing, selling or sharing their browser activity. The bill never made it out of committee â€” an example of the influence of telecommunications and technology companies in California.



But with the ballot measure looming and a growing awareness of how technology companies are gobbling up user information â€” highlighted by revelations that the voter profiling firm Cambridge Analytica gained access to the personal data of millions of Facebook users â€” the legislation went from draft to law in one week.

â€œThis is a huge step forward to people all across the country dealing with this very challenging issue,â€ù State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat and a co-author of the bill, said at a news conference after it was signed.



The ballot initiative, which would have made it easier for private individuals to sue companies for not adhering to its privacy requirements, had drawn vocal opposition from industry groups that worried about the potential liability risk.



The measure included a provision that would have required a 70 percent majority in both houses of the Legislature to approve any changes after it became law.



Google, Facebook, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T each contributed $200,000 to a committee opposing the proposed ballot measure, and lobbyists had estimated that businesses would spend $100 million to campaign against it before the November election.



Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association, an industry group that includes Google, Facebook and Amazon, said in a statement that the new law contained many â€œproblematic provisions.â€ù But the group did not try to obstruct it, he added, because â€œit prevents the even worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.â€ù



Mr. Callahan said the group would â€œwork to correct the inevitable, negative policy and compliance ramifications this last-minute deal will create.â€ù



Legislators said they expected to pass â€œcleanup billsâ€ù to make any fixes to the law in the 18 months before it takes effect. Some privacy advocates are worried that lobbyists for business and technology groups will use that time to water it down.



Mr. Mactaggart said those concerns are â€œoverblown.â€ù



â€œHaving gotten this right, itâ€™ll be very hard to take it away,â€ù he said, noting that the ballot measure had been polling at around 80 percent approval. â€œThey canâ€™t rewrite the law.â€ù""",,6/29/18,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,06:55.0,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,06:55.0168,IPO Market Posts Blistering First Half ,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ipo-market-posts-blistering-first-half-1530523801 ,Capital Markets,Wall Street Journal," ""IPO Market Posts Blistering First Half 

U.S., global IPO fundraising is on pace for one of the best years on record 





By 

Maureen Farrell 

The Wall Street Journal

July 2, 2018 5:30 a.m. ET 



An IPO market that was left for dead just two years ago has come roaring back in 2018, with companies raising public capital at a pace rarely seen in the past two decades.

So far this year, 120 companies have used initial public offerings to raise $35.2 billion on U.S. exchanges. That is the highest volume since 2012 and the fourth-busiest year-to-date on record, according to Dealogic, whose data go back to 1995.

Bankers say no single catalyst is pushing companies to tap the public markets for capital. Instead, the surge has been caused by a convergence of favorable business conditions, strong stock markets and investorsâ€™ hunger for high-growth companies.

Those factors have led to offerings by an array of firms varied by size, industry and ageâ€”ranging from the web-storage and collaboration company Dropbox Inc. DBX +1.99% to home-alarm company ADT Inc. ADT -5.03% to big-box retailer BJâ€™s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc.

The total amount raised doesnâ€™t count one of the largest and most high-profile companies to go public in the U.S. this year. Swedish music-sharing company Spotify Technology SA went public without raising any money through a so-called direct listing.

IPO issuance began to pick up pace last year after a moribund 2016. Helping along this yearâ€™s rush: Companies are no longer worried they may have to go public at valuations below those they had achieved in the private markets, as a disconnect has largely been erased between public and private-market valuations.

Bankers and lawyers expect the rapid IPO pace to continue for the rest of the year.

â€œOur global IPO pipeline is stronger now than itâ€™s been since the financial crisis,â€ù said Evan Damast, global head of equity and fixed income syndicate at Morgan Stanley . 

Companies that have gone public in the U.S. this year are trading, on average, 22% above their IPO price, and technology companies have done particularly well, up 53% above their IPO price, according to Dealogic data through Thursdayâ€™s close of trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose less than 2% for the year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 8.7%, during the same period.

â€œThis year weâ€™re finding the investor demand for technology IPOs is literally the highest weâ€™ve ever seen both in terms of the quantity and quality of interest,â€ù said Madhu Namburi, JPMorgan Chase & Co.â€™s head of technology investment banking.

Not that this has dented private-market activity. Many companies continue to raise vast sums there. That companies are tapping both private and public markets defies expectations that companies would largely turn to IPOs once private funding tightened. Activity so far this year has made it clear both markets can thrive in tandem, at least for now.

â€œPrivate markets primarily facilitate companies to raise capital. A public IPO is a landmark event for a company that goes far beyond just raising capital,â€ù said Mr. Namburi. Employees of public companies, he said, have a clear sense of the wealth theyâ€™ve earned, and public companies have a currency to use for acquisitions and for future capital-raising.

The largest private companies, including Airbnb Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and WeWork Cos., which have raised vast amounts of private capital, are expected to hold off on going public until at least 2019, according to people familiar with the companiesâ€™ plans.

Another closely watched IPO candidate, ride-hailing firm Lyft Inc., recently raised $600 million from mutual fund and hedge-fund investors including Fidelity Investments.

And SoftBank Group Corp. continues to pour money into private companies through its $92 billion tech-focused Vision Fund, extending the IPO timelines of its portfolio companiesâ€”and pushing up their private valuations.

Bankers expect to see a steady pace of multibillion-dollar technology companies going public in the U.S. the rest of this year. Among them: Sonos Inc.; Upwork; SurveyMonkey; and Eventbrite Inc.

Tech IPOs, mostly software companies, have been going strong, raising $12.2 billion in 28 deals in the first half of 2018, nearly double the volume from the same period in 2017 and a more-than-tenfold increase from 2016â€™s volume, according to Dealogic.

The largest IPOs in the second half of 2018 are expected to come out of China. Many of the largest Chinese companies planning to debut in 2018, including Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi Corp., will do so in Hong Kong as its stock exchange changed its listing rules this year to allow companies with dual-class shares to list there.

An exception is Tencent Music Entertainment Group, Chinaâ€™s largest music-streaming company, which is expected to go public in the U.S. and is expected to be one of the largest IPOs of the year, according to people familiar with the deal.

While 2018 could be a near-record year, bankers and lawyers are betting activity could continue to accelerate from there. â€œThereâ€™s a real chance that 2019 could be even stronger than 2018,â€ù said JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s Mr. Namburi.

[This article appears in our August 2018 issue of ETF Report.]



The emerging market (EM) story is facing strains. After a stunning rally in 2017 that took the MSCI Emerging Markets Index up by 37.3%, stocks of developing countries have struggled so far this year. The index briefly hit a decade-high in January before steadily dripping lower to last trade with a year-to-date loss of 6.7%.



ETFs tied to emerging markets, like the $46 billion iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) and the $59 billion Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO), have followed suit to the downside, raising sharp divides in the analyst community about whether this is a buying opportunity or the start of a more severe downturn in the asset class.

On one side, you have analysts like those at UBS, who see 'solid rally potential' in emerging market equities, while on the other, you have analysts like those at Morgan Stanley who expect an 'outright bear market' for EM.



Rising Dollar Sinks EM



No matter which side of the debate they land on, analysts tend to agree on one thingâ€•a rising dollar is negative for emerging market equities. Since the start of 2018, the U.S. Dollar Index has climbed nearly 3% to last trade near a one-year high.



A climbing dollar hurts returns for U.S. investors who invest in emerging market stocks, which are typically denominated in emerging market currencies.



'When the dollar is rising, it tends to bring money back towards the U.S.' as  'investors take off the risk trade,' said Geoff Dennis, head of global emerging markets strategy at UBS. EM traditionally does very poorly during times of a rising dollar, as investors 'pick away at the weaker stories within emerging markets,' he added.



In addition to hurting investors' returns, a stronger dollar: makes it more difficult for emerging market countries to finance their dollar-denominated debts; reduces foreign investment in emerging markets, hurting economic growth; and tends to weigh on EM foreign currency reserves as central banks draw them down to stabilize their domestic currencies.



The dollar's pull on emerging markets is so powerful that even bullish analysts such as UBS' Dennis concede that, were the greenback to rally further, the outlook for the asset class would be severely challenged.



Trade War Uncertainty



Closely tied to the rising dollar (and equivalently, falling emerging market currencies), are sharply rising interest rates. To stem the decline in their currencies, central banks from Turkey to India to Indonesia have recently hiked rates.



All else equal, higher rates are a drag on growth.



Adding to the growth worries is the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and Chinaâ€•one of the biggest risks not just to emerging markets, but the overall global economy. As of July 3, the U.S. was set to begin collecting tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6, and that could just be the tip of the iceberg if President Trump follows through on his most damaging threats.



A trade war is certainly not a good thing for the world's second-largest economy and the world's largest emerging market. However, at least now, it's too early to say that the nascent trade conflict will jeopardize China's official 6.5% GDP growth target.



Instead, the biggest threat of the brewing trade war may be the uncertainty it creates for China and emerging markets in general.



'While the direct round-one macroeconomic impact in terms of GDP reductions is likely to be quite small, we don't know where this is going to stop, and these things are often quite complex in how they feed through into the overall economy,' explained Jonathan Garner, chief emerging market strategist for Morgan Stanley.



'Given that degree of uncertainty, we marked our multiple assumptions lower across the board,' he added. Garner has a 1,000 target on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, 5% lower than current levels.



Positive Fundamentals



Not everyone is convinced that uncertainty is enough of a reason to abandon emerging markets. UBS' Dennis believes that emerging markets' positive fundamentals remain largely intact.



According to him, the sell-off in EM currencies has been relatively narrow, with weakness contained to countries such as Turkey, Brazil, Mexico and othersâ€•not the type of indiscriminate selling one would expect if fundamentals were truly deteriorating.



Likewise, he says GDP downgrades among emerging markets have been fairly limited. In fact, there have been more upgrades than downgrades, with overall economic growth for the group as a whole still expected to exceed 5%.



Earnings growth is also anticipated to be robust. The consensus still sees profits for emerging market companies growing by 15.9% this year, while UBS sees even better growth of 18%.



A Lot More Cracks



Of course, the outlook for EM today may be very different than the outlook for EM tomorrow or months down the line, if certain negative risks materialize. That's what Carmen Reinhart, professor of the international financial system at Harvard University, fears.



She recently told Bloomberg that the outlook for EM has 'a lot more cracks than it did five years ago' due to both external and internal conditions. Reinhart said the group is particularly vulnerable to a rising dollar and borrowing costs because more than two-thirds of emerging market debt is dollar-denominated.



Even debt denominated in local currencies is at risk because 'internal debt is increasingly being held by nonresidents, making for bigger spillovers,' she explained.



Meanwhile, many lower-income EM countries, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, 'have become indebted to China' and 'will have a lot of debt-servicing difficulties,' Reinhart added.



The Harvard professor stopped short of calling for doom and gloom, but said EM has a lot of vulnerabilitiesâ€•especially Argentina, which is likely to see a serious recession imminently, in her view.



Little Risk Of Funding Crisis



The analysts at Research Affiliates have a completely different interpretation of the risks for emerging markets. They agree:  Argentina is a high-risk country (and, incidentally, one that won't officially be incorporated into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index until next year). Turkey, Indonesia and a few others also fit into the â€œhigh riskâ€ù bucket.



But add all those countries together and they only account for less than 20% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Another 20% of the index, including Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, they deem â€ùmoderate risk,â€ù and a full 60% of the index, China, India, Korea and Russia included, are considered â€œlow risk.â€ù



According to the analysts, none of these big emerging markets presents 'any measurable risk of a funding crisis.' Additionally, 'all have low external-debt-to-GDP ratios and ample FX reserves, and most run current account surpluses,' they added in their recent commentary.



Valuation isn't a reason to worry, either. The analysts say that prior to the '97-98 emerging market crisis, the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio for emerging markets was higher than that of the U.S. Today it's less than half that of the U.S.



'When the risks and the bad news are well-known to the market and fear reigns supreme, itâ€™s time to buy, not sell,' they concluded.""",,7/5/18,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,24:56.8,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,24:56.8170,"Start-up Seeks to Stuff IRAs With PE, Bitcoin, Alts",http://ignites.com/c/2021723/237503/start_seeks_stuff_iras_with_bitcoin_alts?referrer_module=emailMorningNews&module_order=0&code=YzJGeVlTNW5jbTlvYkVCbWFXNXlZUzV2Y21jc0lERXdNak0xTmpBc0lERTJOamd5T0RnMU9ERT0,Retirement Products,Ignites," ""Start-up Seeks to Stuff IRAs With PE, Bitcoin, Alts



By Emile Hallez July 5, 2018



The founder of an IRA start-up Goldman Sachs picked up in 2016 recently brought another retirement plan service to market â€“ one packed with alternative investments ranging from Bitcoin to real estate.

Austin-based Rocket Dollar, the new venture of Honest Dollar founder Henry Yoshida, wants account holders to consider â€œcryptocurrency, peer-to-peer lending, startups, private equity and real estate, in addition to traditional stocks, bonds and index funds,â€ù the firm said in an announcement this week.



The companyâ€™s individual-401(k) and IRA services went live in June, more than two years after Goldman Sachs bought Honest Dollar. At the time, Honest Dollar, an IRA and robo-advice program for small and midsize companies, provided six portfolios using a mix of Vanguard ETFs. Goldman has since revamped the model portfolios to include iShares ETFs and State Street underlying funds.



But Yoshidaâ€™s new venture is dramatically different. Rather than providing ready-to-go portfolios to small companiesâ€™ plans, Rocket Dollar caters to individual do-it-yourself investors.

â€œWhat I learned in launching [Honest Dollar] was that a lot of things that were out there were really the same,â€ù Yoshida says. The differences in services between that company and others, like Acorns or Wealthfront, seem minimal, he says, noting that the allocations and investment products do not vary widely.



For retirement investors, â€œthe entire decision on where to put your money was based on price.â€ù

But he says he sees a market in investors who want to invest substantially in categories other than traditional stock and bond mutual funds.

â€œYou have people with multiple IRAs, with old 401(k)s, with no incentive to roll them into one consolidated IRAâ€ù because they are effectively limited to the same types of index funds, he says. Such investors have no meaningful access to alternative investment options, he says. â€œThe money they do have is trapped in these types of retirement accounts.â€ù

Depending on what asset classes they seek and on each investorâ€™s goal, Rocket Dollar could serve as their primary retirement savings vehicle or as an auxiliary account that gives them access to a specific investment, such as a turnkey rental property, Yoshida says.

â€œThey can make an entire portfolio out of private investments,â€ù he notes.

Though volatile asset classes such as cryptocurrency could be risky as a primary holding, a 3% to 4% allocation in a portfolio serves to provide greater diversification, he says.

Yoshida is not the first to show interest in expanding tax-deferred retirement assets to alternative asset classes.





Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein recently railed against accredited investor standards that keep many people from being able to invest in complex strategies.



Further, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman last year spoke of his â€œdreamâ€ù of having private equity investments available to 401(k) participants. Schwarzmanâ€™s comments preceded the companyâ€™s acquisition of a major stake in Aonâ€™s benefits business, which has since been rebranded as Alight Solutions.



Rocket Dollarâ€™s Yoshida says he got the idea for the business after a 28-year-old Lyft driver in Denver told him that his savings represented about $100,000 in non-retirement assets invested across four different non-traditional categories. The driver was familiar with Honest Dollar because of Lyftâ€™s partnership with the company, but he didnâ€™t know what services Charles Schwab provided, even though that firm has a large office nearby, Yoshida says.



For investors who want to bulk up on real estate, doing so in a tax-deferred retirement account could be beneficial, he argues.



Demand for access to alts could rise with growing intergenerational wealth transfer, as millennials inherit chunks of money from their parents and want greater diversification than they can get in a 401(k), he says.



Currently, Rocket Dollar does not provide advice, only access to investments, he notes. But the company might consider an advice service in the future.

The firm charges investors a $15 monthly account fee as well as a $360 registration fee.



While expanding investment choices for investors can be positive, gaining tax-deferred access to alternatives is unlikely to contribute much to the countryâ€™s overall savings level, says Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, associate director of research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, in an e-mail.



â€œAnybody who would be discouraged from participating in a savings plan because it lacked alternatives is sophisticated and so is probably already saving,â€ù Sanzenbacher says.

Unsophisticated investors are unlikely to opt for alternatives, he says, but â€œI imagine having alternatives in 401(k)s would only help the small subset of people who choose to actively manage those assets.â€ù

By Bradley Saacks July 6, 2018



The wirehouses have not completely locked out new products from their partners, but the open-door policy of before is over.



With Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and UBS, among other large distributors, cutting down their shelves, product development teams have felt the pressure to focus on products that have the best chance of making it onto wirehousesâ€™ menus.





Instead of focusing on trying to break onto shrinking platforms, managers should look to the growing RIA market to incubate new products, a new Cerulli Associates study argues.



For managers, the process would require little tweaking, as both channels â€” the wirehouses and RIAs â€” have begun to resemble each other more and more, says Tom Oâ€™Shea, director of managed accounts research at Cerulli.



â€œThe RIAs are starting to look a lot like large broker-dealers. They typically have a chief investment officer or a committee,â€ù he says.



â€œTheir needs are going to look a lot like the needs of high-wealth advisors at broker-dealers.â€ù



Cerulli found that assets in the RIA space have also become more consolidated. In 2016, despite 72% of RIAs managing less than $100 million, RIAs with more than a billion in assets controlled more than half of the assets in the channel.



â€œThe size of an advisory practice is a better indicator of investment specialization than channel [in which the advisor sits]. Almost 40% of advisory practices with more than $500 million in assets under management have a dedicated research analyst or chief investment officer,â€ù the report notes.



As a result, the types of conversations asset managersâ€™ sales teams have with large RIAs are often similar in tenor to those a key accounts person might have at a broker-dealer home office, says Tom Hoops, head of business development at Legg Mason.



Legg has used its two advisor councils â€” one on the East Coast and one on the West Coast â€” that the firm surveys several times a year on client needs to determine the needs of advisors outside of the wirehouse space.

â€œWeâ€™ve seen success there with some of the new strategies and new vehicles,â€ù he says.



Legg has also adapted to shrinking space on wirehouse shelves by offering strategies in multiple vehicles.



â€œWirehouses want fewer partners going forward, and we believe being able to offer a strategy in an SMA, in an ETF, in a CIT is going to help set us apart,â€ù Hoops says.



â€œWe continue to see growth in the wire channel when others might be seeing a pullback.â€ù



For new strategies though, RIAs often offer an easier path, since advisors in the channel tend to have less strict requirements around track records or minimum asset levels than do wirehouse home offices.



â€œIn some of the RIA channel, there is the ability to introduce more and more sophisticated products,â€ù says Jim Cove, senior VP of investment strategies and product management at Natixis Investment Managers.



But product development teams are not just focused on what to roll out next. They also must examine what to do with existing product, says Cove, who adds that he has been â€œfocused more than everâ€ù on the multi-affiliateâ€™s product suiteâ€™s relevance.



An Ignites examination of funds found managersâ€™ lines still densely populated with older, low-asset funds, and Cove expects liquidations of â€™40 Act products to continue to outpace fund launches for â€œthe foreseeable future.â€ù



â€œProduct development right now is very challenging. It is something that has to be very targeted and supported by all levels of the organization,â€ù Cove says.""",,7/6/18,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,38:55.4,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,38:55.4172,Should 401(k) Plans Embrace Alternative Investments?,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/871895/should-401k-plans-embrace-alternative-investments.html,Retirement Products,Morningstar," ""Rekenthaler Report 

Should 401(k) Plans Embrace Alternative Investments?

John Rekenthaler 

06 Jul 2018 



New Ideas

The fund industry's trade publication, Ignites, reports that a startup is providing 401(k) plans with a difference. (No link, paywalled.) Rocket Dollar's offering 'enables you to invest beyond traditional stocks and bonds.' Rocket Dollar 401(k) plans enable their owners to buy cryptocurrency, rental properties, and venture-capital funds. Perhaps they wish to make small business loans. When it comes to possible investments, 'the sky's the limit' for those who board the Rocket Dollar...rocket.

Well, sort of. The company's website carries the warning that the investments must be 'allowed by the IRS.' That eliminates collectibles, including gold coins. Missing is another caveat: Many of Rocket Dollar's suggested investments are, by SEC regulations, private placements for accredited investors. Rank-and-file employees need not apply.

But never mind that. Assume for the moment that the investment sky is indeed the limit--which it may well become, with the current Washington administration seeking financial deregulation. Would that be beneficial? If that answer is 'Yes,' will 401(k) participants avail themselves of the opportunity? 

Basic investment math indicates that Rocket Dollar is on to something. Harry Markowitz earned his Nobel for demonstrating that portfolios are not built on expected returns and risk alone. How the holdings interact also matters. The less they sing in harmony, the better. Clearly, Rocket Dollar's suggested investments offer excellent diversification--better than is normally available in 401(k) plans. Its menagerie quacks, barks, and howls.

At What Cost?

Now come the drawbacks.

The first problem is that the rent is too damn high. When two professors at the Air Force Academy (William Jennings and Brian Payne) examined how diversifying into nonstandard asset classes would work in practice, as opposed to the cost-free assumption that is used in theory, they concluded that 'Fees Eat Diversification's Lunch.' They write, 'We show that the fees on diversifying asset classes can be astonishingly high [the authors' italics] relative to their diversification benefit.' Often, they find, the extra costs of exotic securities fully consume their advantages. The profits are reaped by the investment managers, not the shareholders.

The authors are particularly wary of hedge funds, private-equity funds, global bonds, and 'narrow mandates in public equity' (that is, sector funds or style-constricted funds, such as small-company value). They are somewhat more sanguine about emerging-markets equity and real assets, although even in those areas only a 'subset' of investments were attractive. 

Not Transparent

A second concern is that even if Rocket Dollar's customers have access to appropriately priced options--the company's website is currently mum on the details--they won't necessarily be positioned to make sound investment decisions. Nonpublic securities are exactly that: nonpublic. Third-party reports on such securities are scarce at best. For the most part, the prospective buyer must rely on the word of the issuer.

This, as any experienced investor realizes, is an obstacle. It is not that 401(k) participants should be wary of Wall Street bearing gifts, but rather that they should be prudent. As Ronald Reagan advised, 'Trust but verify.' (Upon further thought, that approach is too generous. The investment motto should be instead, 'Don't trust until you have verified.') However, for many of Rocket Dollar's plan options, verification will not be possible. They must be purchased on faith. 

To summarize, having access to exotic, nonstandard investments makes perfect sense â€_ in a laboratory. Elsewhere, it is problematic. This is no fault of Rocket Dollar's. The 401(k) plan provider does not set its offerings' prices, nor does it give investment advice. Rather, it serves as a conduit, by connecting buyers (company employees) and sellers (investment-management firms, bitcoin owners, those seeking loans, and so forth).

Specialized Tastes

Happily, I believe the answer to my second question--'Will 401(k) participants avail themselves of the opportunity?'--addresses much of these concerns. For the foreseeable future, Rocket Dollar will appeal to a small clientele. It will not reach the mainstream.

To explain: 20 years ago, open brokerage platforms for 401(k) plans were the rage. As they became more experienced at investing, it was believed, employees would not longer be satisfied with off-the-rack 401(k)s and would instead seek to customize their holdings. That did not occur; few 401(k) participants opened brokerage accounts. 

Indeed, most employees found the idea distinctly unappealing. They did not seek greater complexity. On the contrary, they wished for things to become simpler. Thus, employees voted with their feet to do less with their 401(k) plan, not more, by gravitating toward target-date funds. Target-date funds were off-the-shelf, as opposed to being customized, but they had the blessing of being easy to select.

(In 1998, I paid $150 to open a 401(k) brokerage account, so that I could avail myself of more than 10,000 stocks and mutual funds. Those trades never happened. One thing led to another, and inertia took hold. Just as well. My $150 expenditure was a pittance compared with my potential losses, had I bought the stocks that caught my eye.) 

Of course, there are always exceptions. Per Ignites, Rocket Dollar's founder, Henry Yoshida, was inspired to start the firm after talking with a 28-year old Lyft driver who had invested $100,000 in alternatives, outside of a 401(k) plan. (Count me impressed--When I was 28 years old, my net worth was negative.) That driver, clearly, is Rocket Dollar's target market.

Generation Gap

Perhaps other millennials will be, as well, when they accumulate enough assets and become old enough to take retirement planning seriously. Perhaps for them, the distinction the older generations make between conventional investments (stocks, bonds, and mutual funds) and 'alternatives' such as cryptocurrencies, real estate, and unregistered funds will seem artificial. Perhaps the costs for alternatives will decline, and the available information will rise.

Perhaps. But if so, it will be a slow build. Few 401(k) participants will own bitcoin in their plans anytime soon.

1. Know clientsâ€™ dreams. To tighten your bonds, dig deeper.



The Financial Planning Association wants to hear from you. The FPA, together with the research firm Capital Preferences and T. Rowe Price, is conducting a study focused on how financial advisors can better understand investor behavior. Itâ€™s based largely on responses from advisors and planners.



The study will cover such issues as:



How financial planners and advisors are changing their client understanding practices in order to support more holistic advice



What changes to those practices can support co-planning with clients, behavioral coaching and other ways advisors can add value to the relationship



What tools and technologies are delivering a more efficient client discovery experience

The research is divided into three parts: a series of qualitative interviews with planners and thought leaders that began in April; a benchmarking survey that is currently underway and will end July 25, which advisors can participate in; and another qualitative phase that kicks off in July and ends in September.



Advisors can participate in the benchmarking survey, titled The State of Client Understanding, by clicking on the link. When they complete the survey, they will gain access to initial key findings and eventually a customized benchmarking report when the research is concluded.



The results of the survey plus qualitative interviews will be presented at the FPAâ€™s annual conference in Chicago on Oct. 3-5.



In addition to benchmarking, the study will provide a step-by-step roadmap that can help advisors best serve their clients.

â€œThe firms and advisors that excel in the next decade will be those that know their clients best â€“ the ones that turn client understanding into their competitive advantage,â€ù said Bernard Del Rey, CEO of Capital Preferences, in a statement.



The firm is the creator of the TrueProfile tool that helps advisors gauge the risk tolerance, loss aversion and decision consistency of clients. Its co-founder, Shachar Kariv, who heads the economics department at UC Berkeley, specializes in behavioral decision making and has said that â€œexisting investor profiling methods are crude and statistically unjustifiable.â€ù



George Riedel, head of U.S. Intermediaries at T. Rowe Price, which is co-sponsoring the study, said in a statement, â€œIn todayâ€™s ever-changing environment â€_ it is critical to provide advisors with actionable insightsâ€ù to help â€œdeepen their knowledge and understanding of their clientsâ€™ needs, which ultimately helps to build their practice.â€ù""",,7/9/18,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,05:07.6,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,05:07.6178,Must-Knows About Qualified Opportunity Funds,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/871639/mustknows-about-qualified-opportunity-funds.html,Mutual Funds,Morningstar," ""Must-Knows About Qualified Opportunity Funds

 06 Jul 2018



The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on Dec. 22, 2017, established new tax codes that provide significant tax deferral opportunities for recently realized capital gains when they are invested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF or O Fund) for at least five years. There are still many unanswered questions about how exactly this will work in practice, and investors are waiting on soon-to-be-released Treasury Department regulations for guidance. But there is substantial interest on the part of large private client banks, hedge funds and ultrahigh-net-worth individuals.



Here are some must-knows so far.



What is an Opportunity Zone?

State governors were asked to identify economically distressed communities that also showed a real potential for revitalization. Many of these zones truly are suffering in terms of low household income, joblessness rates, age of housing stock, and eligibility for low income housing tax credits, to name a few. More than two thirds of the zones also contain a Brownfield site, which are eligible for EPA grants to fund the cleanup of environmental problems. About three fourths of O-Zones are in urban areas, with the remainder located in rural communities.



The Treasury Department reviewed the list and certified over 8,700 O-Zones. A real concern was that areas already undergoing gentrification would be over-represented, but the Urban Institute found less than 4% of zones had high enough levels of economic growth from 2000 to 2016 to be considered a community in upward transition. The nonprofit group Enterprise Community Partners has created a tool identifying eligible O-Zones.



What is a Qualified Opportunity Fund?

A QOF is an investment vehicle created for investing in eligible property located within an O-Zone and provides a tax benefit to investors who invest realized capital gains from other investments into the fund. The fund can buy the stock of any business, whether newly formed or expanding, not classified as a 'sin' business, such as tanning salons, liquor stores, adult entertainment, casinos, racetracks, etc. It can buy a partnership interest that holds businesses within the zone and it can own tangible property directly.



If a QOF buys real estate, it must substantially improve that property for it to be considered an eligible investment. For example, buying an existing home and converting it to a multifamily rental would qualify, but substantial improvement requires an investment over 30 months that exceeds the adjusted basis. This is a much higher standard than in other programs.







The businesses must generate at least 50% of their gross income from activity conducted in the zone. The QOF can only invest in the equity of businesses, and 90% of the fund's assets must be invested within an O-Zone, although investments can be made in multiple zones. A qualified fund is described as a corporation or partnership, and it is unclear whether the limited liability corporation may be used.



Any taxpayer can create a QOF by self-certifying on a form (which has yet to be created by the Treasury Department) and attaching it to the tax return. The investor does not need to live or work in the O-Zone to receive the tax benefits of investing in the fund. More details about existing regulations, as well as information about questions yet to be resolved, can be found at the Economic Innovation Group's website. The bipartisan public policy organization, headed by Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook and founder of Napster, was the driving force behind the O-Zone program, which was incorporated into the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act under the leadership of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who proposed it as an amendment.



What's in It for the Investor?

There are three tax benefits available depending on how long an investor holds the QOF interest.



Tax Deferral

An investor who has or is about to realize capital gains from any other investment (stocks, real estate, sale of a business, etc.) can elect to invest the amount of that gain into a QOF and the capital gain will be deferred until the earlier of two dates: when the interest in the QOF is sold or Dec. 31, 2026. The gains must have been realized within 180 days of the QOF purchase to be eligible for tax deferral.



Tax Reduction

Because the capital gains are invested in the fund before tax, the investor has zero basis in the fund. If the QOF interest is held for at least five years, 10% of the amount of the capital gain will be added to the investor's basis in the fund, thus reducing by 10% the amount of gain that eventually will be taxed.



If the investor holds the QOF shares for another two years, another 5% of the amount of the deferred gain will be added to the basis amount for a total 15% reduction in gain after seven years.



Tax Forgiveness

If the investor holds his or her interest in the fund for 10 years, the fair market value on the sale of the QOF shares is deemed the tax cost basis, thus not generating a taxable gain.



Based on what we know so far, here's a hypothetical of how taxation should work.



Let's assume $100,000 of capital gain is invested into a QOF on July 1, 2018, and held for 12 years (if possible; we don't know for sure if the funds must liquidate or can continue). After the fifth year, the cost basis should become $10,000, thus $90,000 of gain is deferred. After the seventh year, the cost basis should become $15,000, thus $85,000 of gain is deferred. On Dec. 31, 2026, the deferred gain should become taxable regardless of whether the QOF interest has been sold. This represents a phantom income for the investor.



On July 1, 2028, any gain from the activity of the fund should become nontaxable. So, it seems, the investor will have to determine if enough potential gain exists from the QOF activity to warrant paying tax on $85,000 of capital gain in 2026 when no proceeds are available for the tax payment.



There are many other legal and accounting issues the Treasury Department is expected to address this summer. The Economic Innovation Group estimates investors are holding $6 trillion in unrealized capital gains, which represents an enormous potential investment. There are many big players lined up to create QOFs as soon as the regulations and the certifying form are available. We can only hope this program really will raise the economic vitality of thousands of struggling communities in addition to providing a tax-break for capital gains.""",,7/10/18,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,41:37.2,GrohlS@corp.root.nasd.com,41:37.2179,What the Stuttering Corporate Bond Market Means for Stocks,https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-stuttering-corporate-bond-market-means-for-stocks-1531139187,Capital Markets,Wall Street Journal," ""What the Stuttering Corporate Bond Market Means for Stocks

Stocks and corporate bond returns are diverging. Thatâ€™s an important signal to watch

By 

Richard Barley

U.S. stocks have managed to grind out gains this year, despite a wild ride. Thatâ€™s not true of U.S. corporate bonds, the yin to stocksâ€™ yang. But the stuttering credit market could in time become a problem for stocks, too.

While the total return for the S&P 500 is north of 4% this year, U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds have been heading steadily in the wrong direction since February. The spread between the yield on U.S. Treasurys and that on investment-grade company debt has widened to 1.28 percentage points, from a postcrisis low of 0.9 percentage point at the start of February, ICE BofAML index data show. The index has returned minus 2.7% this year, underperforming Treasurys, down 0.9%.

The move isnâ€™t as dramatic as this yearâ€™s blowup in Italian bonds, or steep drops in emerging-market currencies. But it has shown little sign of reversing, even as more economically sensitive assets such as stocks and high-yield bonds have posted modest gains, shored up by the idea that U.S. growth is strong relative to the rest of the world.

The selloff has taken the yield on corporate bonds above 4% for the first time since 2011. Company debt was previously buoyed by ultraloose monetary policy. Now the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and starting to wind down its balance sheet. This brings companies into greater competition for dollar funding, especially with short-dated U.S. Treasury yields now at a 10-year high. Previously there was little alternative for yield-seeking investors but to buy riskier debt.

And the corporate bond market is bigger and riskier than ever. The ICE BofAML index now contains more than $6 trillion of bonds, more than double the amount 10 years ago. Nearly half of it is rated triple-B, the lowest investment-grade category.

Previous bouts of turmoil, such as when plunging oil prices and fears about global growth rocked markets in early 2016, lured investors into corporate bonds. Now investors seem suspicious of buying the dip. The probability that U.S. investment-grade bond returns will beat Treasurys over the next 12 months is now 47%, down from 61% a year ago, according to a survey of over 200 investors by Absolute Strategy Research. The same investors are still relatively bullish on earnings but seem to see more opportunity to benefit through stocks than bonds.

The end of easy money is slowly eroding a key support for company balance sheets. This, in turn, will eat away at their earnings and risk appetite. Stock investors shouldnâ€™t ignore the trouble brewing in corporate bond markets.

Fidelity Model Portfolios debuts with five different portfolios consisting of 7 to 12 Fidelity funds, based on risk tolerance.



By Bernice Napach | July 12, 2018 at 02:34 PM



Fidelity Investments has joined the growing group of asset managers offering model portfolios for advisor clients.



Fidelity Model Portfolios debuted Thursday with an initial offering of five different asset mixes called Target Allocation Model Portfolios. The portfolios consist entirely of Fidelity mutual funds with stock/bond allocations based on different risk profiles, ranging from a conservative 20% stocks/80% bonds portfolio to an aggressive 85% stocks/15% bonds mix. In between are stock/bond ratios of 40/60, 60/40 and 70/30.



There are 7 to 12 funds in each portfolio chosen from a group of 39 Fidelity funds, both active (Fidelity Advisor funds) and passive (Index Funds). Target allocations will rebalance quarterly and the average expense ratios range from 36 to 40 basis points. There are no additional advisory fees.



Fidelity is marketing Model Portfolios as a means for advisors to deliver the services their clients want, which stretch well beyond investment management and asset allocation, while operating in an environment where fee compression is rampant.



â€œWith this new offering, advisors can feel confident that theyâ€™re delivering institutional-quality portfolios, and they can spend more time focusing on services that can help them deliver even higher value, including helping their clients achieve their life goals,â€ù said Matt Goulet, senior vice president, Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, in a statement. â€œAdvisors are increasingly demanding choice,â€ù Goulet told ThinkAdvisor.



All financial advisors can access Fidelity Model Portfolios, not just advisors who use Fidelityâ€™s platform.



With its latest offering, Fidelity joins Vanguard, BlackRock, TD Ameritrade and other asset managers and custodians already providing model portfolios.



Model portfolios benefit both advisors and asset managers, says Tim Welsh, president of Nexus Strategy, a consulting firm to the wealth management industry. â€œAdvisors can easily access the models from the big asset managers to build and manage portfolios for â€˜free,â€™ while the asset managers get distribution electronically and donâ€™t need to rely on costly wholesalers.â€ù

In its announcement, Fidelity cited research from Cerulli Associates, noting that 81% of advisors use some type of model when constructing clientsâ€™ portfolios. Cerulli estimates that $6 trillion is invested in managed accounts and the number is expected to grow over 14% annually over the next few years.



As of May 31, Fidelity had $2.5 trillion in assets under management and another $4.5 trillion under administration. The privately owned asset manager serves more than 12,500 advisory firms with investment and technology solutions, 27 million individuals and 23,000 businesses managing employee benefit programs.

Pullback comes during period of market swings tied to trade policy tensions, interest rate increases

Justin Baer and

 

Mengqi Sun

Updated July 13, 2018 5:58 p.m. ET

The flood of money into low-cost index funds is slowing in 2018, testing Americansâ€™ unprecedented embrace of passively managed investments during a nine-year-old bull market for stocks.

Net inflows into U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that mimic indexes dropped to $3.4 billion in June, according to data compiled by research firm Morningstar.

That was the lowest amount of new monthly money for these funds since early 2014. For the first six months of 2018 passive inflows were down 44%, compared with the same period a year earlier.

The pullback shows that even the darlings of the asset-management industry are vulnerable to volatile markets and investor anxiety over a potential downturn. The first half of the year was marked by swings tied to trade-policy tensions, interest-rate increases and talk of inflation.

â€œWeâ€™ve had essentially flat U.S. equities, a down emerging market, and a down U.S. fixed-income market,â€ù said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA.

Indexing giant Vanguard Group is among the managers grappling with the client pullback. Through the first half of 2018 the companyâ€™s net client flows of $112 billion were down 48% from the same period a year ago. That includes an influx of $10.3 billion in June.

The rise of passive investing has prompted sweeping changes throughout the financial world, from corporate governance to market structure, as well as concerns that the index funds could be vulnerable to unpredictable behavior in another downturn. They have attracted trillions in new client money since the 2008 financial crisis.

Active managers have long argued volatility and falling indexes would help them gain on their passive rivals while showcasing their stock- and bond-picking skills. Some have sought to merge, cut fees or overhaul their product lineups.

But there are no signs yet that most investors are turning in that direction. Actively managed funds have suffered net outflows of more than $500 billion since 2015, according to Morningstar. Roughly $29 billion in client money left those funds during the first half of this year.

The outflows through the first six months of 2018 marked the second six-month period in a row, and fifth of the last six, where active funds had net outflows, according to Morningstar.

â€œPaying more money to be flat or down makes little sense,â€ù Mr. Rosenbluth said.

But outflows for active funds are less sizable than they were several years ago, and some companies are beginning to see inflows. One is American Funds, owned by Los Angeles-based Capital Group Cos. The mutual-fund unit, which manages solely active funds, brought in $997 million in the month of June and had net inflows of $17.95 billion in the first half of this year, according to Morningstar.

Not all active funds are in the same position, said Kevin McDevitt, a research analyst at Morningstar. The most-expensive active funds â€œare losing capital,â€ù he said, while cheaper active funds â€œare doing better in terms of flows.â€ù

No firm is more closely identified with the passive boom than Vanguard, which started the first index mutual fund for individual investors more than four decades ago. In 2017 it attracted a record $369.3 billion from investors, or the equivalent of more than $1 billion a day. It is now the worldâ€™s second-largest money manager, with $5.1 trillion in assets.

The drop-off in investor cash during 2018 is the result of political uncertainty and concerns that the bull market could eventually stop, said Emily Farrell, a Vanguard spokeswoman.

â€œPeople are aware of and are anticipating this slowdown coming,â€ù she said.

Client acquisition costs and increasing competition proved too much for Hedgeable



Jul 16, 2018 @ 2:57 pm By Ryan W. Neal 



The consolidation of direct-to-consumer robo-advisers is in full swing. 

Hedgeable, an early digital adviser that stood out for targeting wealthier clients with active management, hedging strategies and access to alternative investments like venture capital funds and cryptocurrency, announced last week that it will discontinue its investment management service on Aug. 9. 



The news comes just two months after Northwestern Mutual's decision to shut down LearnVest. 



In December, Amanda Steinberg closed WorthFM, a female-focused robo-adviser launched in 2015. The WorthFM website, which now directs users to Sallie Krawcheck's Ellevest, cites 'industry shifts and our own business' as reasons it can no longer offer investment advice. 



The announcement from Hedgeable was surprising, but not entirely unexpected. Industry observers have long forecast doom for the direct-to-consumer startups not named Betterment and Wealthfront as banks, broker-dealers, asset managers, custodians and large RIAs all come out with their own version of digital advice. 



But what's driving the consolidation isn't a market downturn that causes investors to fearfully pull money out of their robo-adviser, as many predicted. Instead, venture-backed startups like Hedgeable simply haven't been able to carve out enough market share to remain sustainable, independent businesses.



The biggest problem is, and has always been, client acquisition costs. Conservative estimates peg the cost per client at $100 for the startups. Michael Kitces, partner and director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group, estimates it could as high as $300, and he has been sounding this alarm since 2016. 



'You need a lot of money in order to be successful as a robo if you're not an incumbent firm, if you're not a broker-dealer and have an existing clientele.' said Ken Schapiro, the president of Backend Benchmarking, a research firm that publishes a quarterly report on robo-adviser performance. 'When [the startups] were originally funded, no one really knew that the client acquisition cost was going to be that high. And now there's a lot more competition; the incumbents all have [a robo-adviser].'



Hedgeable raised a total of $1.9 million in funding (its most recent round was in November 2015) and turned that into 1,698 clients and $80 million in clients, according to its most recent Form ADV. Meanwhile, Betterment raised $275 million and manages $14 billion in client assets, while Wealthfront manages $10 billion after raising $204.5 million. 



The big two robos still pale in comparison to technology products offered at Charles Schwab and Vanguard, primarily because the companies have simply moved existing client assets to their digital platforms. As Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley all push out their own robo-advisers, they can simply offer the service through existing channels.



'Large firms can use it as a loss leader or part of a customer acquisition strategy,' Mr. Schapiro said. 'It's just another arrow in the quiver, and you're going to see more of them from the Goldmans of the world.' 



Most of the other robos have either been purchased, like FutureAdvisor, or have pivoted toward a business-to-business model, like SigFig. 



Mr. Schapiro expects Wealthfront and Betterment are large enough to survive for a while, as well as hybrid robo-provider Personal Capital. 



But the writing is on the wall for other technology startups, and Hedgeable's closure should serve as a wake-up call. 



You're no longer the new tech on the block, and that VC funding will only go so far in buying you customers. I'm looking at you, WiseBanyan.

Rapid expansion of index investing has fueled investor concerns about the pressure passive funds exert on stocks and bonds 



By Asjylyn Loder 

July 18, 2018 5:30 a.m. ET 



The deluge of money flooding into passive investments can swing stock prices, but fears of widespread market disruptions are overblown, according to a new report from S&P Global Inc. 



Investors yanking cash out of index-tracking strategies exacerbated sharp declines in early February, when stocks plunged and volatility surged, according to the report from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the data and research arm of the company behind the indexing business that includes the popular S&P 500 stock index.



Strategies that mimic the S&P 500, including mutual and exchange-traded funds along with other index-tracking investments, may have accounted for as much as one-third of the benchmarkâ€™s almost 3.8% decline on Feb. 8, wrote Daniel Sandberg, a director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, in the report.



â€œThere is an impact and that impact can be significant,â€ù Mr. Sandberg said in an interview.

But the researchers also concluded that the money sloshing into and out of ETFs, in particular, is unlikely to cause widespread price disruptions.



The rapid expansion of index investing has fueled investor concern about the pressure passive funds exert on the stocks and bonds they are meant to track. A resurgence of market turbulence this year intensified concerns about liquidity. Assets in passive funds that try to match the market rather than beat it have quintupled in the past decade to $6.9 trillion, according to research firm Morningstar.



The $3.6 trillion U.S. ETF industry has faced particular scrutiny. Like mutual funds, ETFs package stocks, bonds or other assets into a single share. But unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold on an exchange just like shares of Amazon.com Inc. or Apple Inc. 

 

â€œThey attract investors that want to trade fast,â€ù said Francesco Franzoni, professor of finance at USI Lugano and the Swiss Finance Institute, who co-wrote research showing that stocks included in ETFs become, on average, more volatile.



In the past decade, ETFs have been linked to unusual price swings in oil, Japanese stocks and high-yield debt. In February, ETFs that bet against the Cboe Volatility Index were blamed for a price spike in volatility futures contracts. Last year, a flood of cash into funds that invest in small mining companies was blamed for price gyrations in gold stocks from Sydney to Toronto.



Mr. Sandberg and his colleagues tried to measure the impact of money pouring into and out of passive strategies, and focused particular attention on ETFs. The research was prompted by S&P clients, mostly large institutional investors, who are increasingly concerned that the rapid growth of index-tracking funds may be distorting stock prices.



â€œClients are asking, â€˜How big do ETFs have to get before we get concerned?â€ù said David Pope, a managing director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. â€œItâ€™s everyoneâ€™s underlying fear, that one fund gets so powerful that it starts to move prices in a disruptive manner.â€ù



They found that some stocks are more vulnerable to price moves driven by surges of investor cash. Like many traditional indexes, the S&P 500 is divvied up based on the stock-market value of the underlying companies. But market value has little to do with the availability of the stock, according to the S&P report.



For example, Walmart Inc. accounts for 0.5% of the assets in an S&P 500 index fund, but only 0.1% of the average daily trading volume of S&P 500 stocks in June, according to S&P. By contrast, Netflix Inc. is 0.7% of the benchmarkâ€™s assets, but 3.3% of trading.



ETFs may buy more of a stock than is readily available, forcing prices higher to find more willing sellers. Or they may sell more than the market has an appetite for, pushing prices lower to attract buyers.



â€œThe ETFs just consume everything thatâ€™s available,â€ù Mr. Pope said.

The price impact was â€œmodestâ€ù and tended to disappear within a few days, the report said. 



â€œThereâ€™s not much cause for concern for systemic risk,â€ù Mr. Sandberg said. â€œBut we have been able to quantify that thereâ€™s some minimal impact.â€ù

Some advisers think this indicates other providers will pivot in light of DOL fiduciary rule's death



Jul 18, 2018 @ 3:39 pm By Greg Iacurci 



Fidelity Investments will no longer serve as a fiduciary when it helps employers select investments for their 401(k) plans, moving away from a policy the firm adopted last year in response to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule.



Fidelity, the largest record keeper of defined-contribution plans, began offering these 'point in time' investment fiduciary services to plans with less than $50 million when the DOL regulation took effect in June 2017. Fidelity helped plan sponsors as a fiduciary at a particular moment in time through a one-time investment recommendation; it didn't provide ongoing fiduciary advice. 



However, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the DOL fiduciary rule in March. The Obama-era regulation was officially taken off the books in June, leading Fidelity to change its policy, which had been unique among other providers.



'Without the DOL rule, Fidelity will continue to provide point-in-time investment assistance to plan sponsors as a non-fiduciary under ERISA,' said spokeswoman Nicole Goodnow, referring to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 'This is the same capacity in which Fidelity provided investment assistance to plan sponsors before the DOL rule took effect in June 2017.'



The fiduciary rule, which raised investment advice standards in retirement accounts, changed the calculus for the many record keepers providing investment help to plan sponsors. Many times, that help came in the form of a proposed lineup of 401(k) investments, observers said. If providers had continued interacting with clients in the same way, the DOL regulation would likely have turned their previously non-fiduciary function into a fiduciary one, exposing them to more liability. 



Fidelity was the only record keeper that said it would adapt by providing services as a fiduciary under the new regime, according to retirement plan advisers. This service, which Fidelity offered at no additional cost, concerned advisers who also offered fiduciary investment services and thought Fidelity was competing with them.



However, given the DOL rule's fate, the level of investment guidance is again considered non-fiduciary under ERISA, and Fidelity has distanced itself from the 'fiduciary' label as a result. 



'It doesn't surprise me they're backing away from it,' said Chad Larsen, president and chief executive of advisory firm MRP. 'If they don't have to say that's a fiduciary function, why would they?'



Ellen Lander, a retirement plan adviser at Renaissance Benefit Advisors Group, said the DOL regulation going away is the 'best-case scenario' for service providers, who can revert to their prior way of doing business. She expects that Fidelity's pivot away from its prior policy will be a bellwether for other 401(k) providers.

Hate ETFs? Quants Say They Found Anomaly to Profit on Flows

by Bloomberg News

July 19, 2018|



(Bloomberg) â€” Stock managers sick of being steamrolled by the onslaught of passive funds may have a new weapon to wield, one that was born of the very success their enemies had in overrunning the market.



According to quant strategists at Deutsche Bank, investors can beat equity benchmarks by building portfolios out of stocks that get whipped around the most when exchange-traded funds rebalance.



Bet against the ones they buy, and buy the ones they sell, is what they recommend. If all you did was go long stocks with the most negative ETF flows over the last 12 years, you wouldâ€™ve topped the Russell 3000 Index by 2 percentage points annually. Buying and shorting returned 7.2 percent a year, the firms says. Thatâ€™s more than double the best-performer among 10 factors tracked by Bloomberg over the period.



So enamored are they with their findings that Deutsche Bank strategists led by Ronnie Shah are treating it as the discovery of a new investment anomaly, a systematic way of profiting from errors in investor thinking.



In this case, they say, the error is when traders sense price trends being created by ETF flows, jump in and make them bigger. Since buying and selling by ETFs doesnâ€™t reflect any company-specific knowledge, the trends later reverse, the study holds.



â€œThe proliferation of passive investments is causing distortions,â€ù said Shah, the firmâ€™s head of U.S. quantitative equity strategy. â€œItâ€™s a new anomaly associated with ETF flows that active managers can take advantage of.â€ù



His team is among a growing group of market watchers who seek an edge by studying ETF behavior at a time when indexes outnumber stocks and passive vehicles control more than one fifth of the market cap of the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indexes.



While hedge funds and other speculators have devised any number of strategies to front-run and otherwise exploit passive flows, Shah is among the first to publish a model for doing so over time using rule-based inputs. The success of the strategy relies on the popularity of passive investing, he said.



Lots of trading systems generate big returns on paper and then fail to live up to their promise when let loose in the real world. Shah noted that his model didnâ€™t turn a profit until 2009, when the active-to-passive rotation accelerated. Thatâ€™s also when the bull market began, leading one analyst to question if itâ€™s a coincidence.



â€œSeeing anything turn around in 2009, you have to wonder whether itâ€™s just a good, up market strategy,â€ù said Melissa Brown, head of applied research at Axioma Inc., a provider of tools for risk management and portfolio construction.



Returns such as those reported in the study reflect choices about time frames and trading rules that in any researcherâ€™s hands could be tweaked to maximize output, noted Vincent Deluard, a strategist with INTL FCStone Financial. But Shahâ€™s study looks like â€œa great paperâ€ù with little evidence of data snooping, he said.



â€œThe fact that the results are not that amazing actually increases my confidence in their findings, it suggests little over-optimization,â€ù Deluard said. â€œFrom what I can tell without replicating the work myself, it looks like they were quite diligent.â€ù



A separate paper published this month by S&P Globalâ€™s market intelligence unit found evidence that stocks responded to price pressures created by ETF flows, mainly those created by buying and selling of ETFs in the open market. The effect â€œis transient and of only modest magnitude,â€ù though might also enhance returns if included in a risk model, it said.



Unlike active funds where managers spend months researching fundamentals in the quest to pick winners, an ETF typically tracks an index and only buys and sells when the members change. Rebalancings, which happen on a regular basis, can trigger money flows with only the thinnest connection to a companyâ€™s fundamentals.



The source of inflows isnâ€™t always intuitive. Often a stockâ€™s demotion from a large-cap index can spur passive buying. It takes a bigger share of the small-cap pool than its old weight in large caps, and the downgrade forces ETFs to purchase it.



Such blind buying tends to push share prices beyond whatâ€™s justified by fundamentals, Deutsche Bank says. But the gains and losses later unwind. To exploit the pattern, the firm developed a quantitative model that tracks ETF flows for Russell 3000 companies, and each month it ranks stocks by their performance over the previous 12 months.



Signals from ETF flows have shown low correlation with traditional quantitative factors such as momentum or value, making them â€œan enhancementâ€ù to existing models, according to Deutsche Bank.



Keeping other factors static in a multi-factor model, the strategists found that incorporating ETF flows led to proportionate improvement in performance. The more ETF flows are considered, the better the returns.



â€œWhether or not itâ€™s a factor is debatable,â€ù Shah said. â€œBut this is an anomaly that we found and itâ€™s worth exploring further.â€ù

Authored by 'Rogue Trader' via The ICO Journal,



Working back channels at the SEC and the CFTC in particular, weâ€™ve come across two sources that seem to be â€˜nearly certainâ€™ that the crypto ETF conversation is about to take a seriously bullish turn.



The background for the optimism is tempered with some specific downside: coming crypto and ICO regulations. Both sources said that the â€˜nearly certainâ€™ approval of a Bitcoin ETF and other crypto ETF products will be announced alongside the first set of crypto regulations of substance from both the SEC and the CFTC.



Our most optimistic source, coming from the CFTC, said the following:



â€œI would call it 90% at this point. The crypto markets have moderated and regulators have watched the lack of drama surrounding Bitcoin futures across several global exchanges. The price moderation and adoption of a â€˜peer productâ€™ is what the conversations have centered around. In January we were justifiably concerned about a bubble and the harm a quickly approved product could attract speculators and create losses that led to significant lawsuits. Now, those factors seem to be mitigated significantly.â€ù



The second source, a former SEC employee who left the regulator two weeks ago, had this to say:



â€œI would expect a positive outcome in September â€“ or if it gets strung out a little further it is simply a few â€˜dotted iâ€™s and crossed tâ€™sâ€™ are being finalized on larger regulatory language in the crypto space. To be clear, most of the regulation will be first focused on ICOâ€™s and the issues those pose for retail investors at the moment. US residents are sending money to all sorts of exotic locations to invest in unregulated instruments with absolutely zero recourse for losing every cent theyâ€™ve put at risk. ICO regulation will begin to solve those issues and keep client assets â€˜onshoreâ€™.



Both sources made further comments all having to do with the runway that Bitcoin and crypto futures (Ethereum) have provided for ETF products taking center stage late this year and into 2019.



The regulatory agencies are fully aware that once this door is cracked open it will create a flood of submissions, approvals, new products in every color, shade, and denomination connected to crypto. Thus, the congruent push for regulation that will provide the architecture for fair and equitable markets to surround the newly regulated asset class.



Still, this is big news as we are essentially being told that an approval is all but guaranteed. If you take a look at price movements connected to industries that joined the ETF movement and the institutional assets that followed, an expected spike in prices isnâ€™t far-fetched.



One reason why billionaires and well-known asset managers have been heard discussing, and investing in, cryptocurrencies via pure means or via crypto hedge funds. Interesting indeed.

Investors are finding it harder to buy and sell bonds



By Riva Gold and Christopher Whittall 

July 22, 2018 7:00 a.m. ET 



Many bonds around the globe are becoming harder to trade, prompting some investors to shift to other markets and raising concerns about a broad decline in liquidity.



The median gap between the price at which traders offer to buy and sell, a proxy for the ability to move in and out of markets quickly, has widened this year across European corporate debt and emerging-market government and corporate bonds, according to data from trading platform MarketAxess. Trading in some derivatives has picked up as traders pull back from bond markets they view as increasingly unruly and expensive.

 

Liquidity, a measure of the capacity to trade securities without significantly affecting the price, has been a growing concern since the financial crisis. Traders say it has generally weakened across markets including stocks, bonds and commodities as the large banks that once kept these markets running have pulled back in response to limits on their risk-taking.



But recent episodes of extreme market stress in Italy and emerging markets have highlighted just how quickly trading conditions can deteriorate, exacerbating concerns that markets are becoming more vulnerable to a shock as central banks slow the stimulus they have supplied for a decade.



â€œThe global tide of liquidity that quantitative easing spurred is now slowly, slowly moving in reverse,â€ù said Nathaniel Rosenbaum, credit strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. â€œYouâ€™re starting to see small hot spots emerge in parts of the market that donâ€™t have a natural support,â€ù he said, such as pockets of Europe and Latin America.



In May, Italian two-year government-bond yields notched their biggest one-day jump since at least 1989. The surge was triggered by Italian politics, but a lack of liquidity appeared to amplify the moves as the gap between the price at which traders were willing to buy and where they were willing to sell surged to above half a percentage point, according to Thomson Reuters data.



Alberto Gallo, who runs more than $1 billion in Algebris Investmentsâ€™ Macro Credit strategy, said it took â€œaround 10 times longerâ€ù to unwind a bet on Italian bonds than normal and that it was hard to get bids or offers on trades of more than $10 million in size.



Liquidity â€œwas bad and itâ€™s remained relatively badâ€ù since May, he said.

 

The median bid-ask spread for developed European high-yield credit is up 24% this year, according to MarketAxess, while the spread for investment-grade credit has also widened. In the U.S.â€”home of the deepest capital markets in the worldâ€”the spread on investment-grade credit is holding steady, but it has edged higher in high yield.



For years, central banks helped paper over the decline in market liquidity that occurred when post-crisis regulation made it harder for banks to trade bonds. The current challenge coincides with central banks withdrawing their long-time support for fixed-income markets. The Federal Reserve is shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio and the European Central Bank is trimming its massive bond-buying program.



This past March, Gilles PradÃ¨re, a senior portfolio manager at RAM Active Investments in Switzerland, sought to reduce some of his exposure to investment-grade credit while this market was fairly calm.



To his surprise, â€œwe were confronted with a market which was already deteriorating quite significantlyâ€ù in terms of liquidity, he said.



Many investors like Mr. PradÃ¨re are switching to derivatives contracts for assets they need to trade more regularly, where they say liquidity is better than in the underlying bond market.

 

Trading in Italian government-bond futures rocketed in May, more than doubling the previous yearâ€™s monthly volume, according to Eurex. By contrast, Italian government-bond trading volumes fell 18% over the first half of 2018 compared to the previous year, according to MarketAxess, despite the pickup in volatility, which usually boosts activity. Traders say the greater ease of buying and selling Italian futures meant that market became the main channel for takingâ€”or trimmingâ€”risk.



Similarly, volumes in emerging-market government debt are down 32%, according to MarketAxess. At the same time, credit-derivatives volumes rose substantially in the first half of 2018 compared to previous years, according to strategists at JPMorgan.



Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at Union Bancaire PrivÃ©e, has been slowly switching bond positions into more liquid credit derivatives, noting he expects more episodes of turbulence.



During real high-risk events across bond markets, â€œno one is able to trade,â€ù he said.

Trading derivatives has its own drawbacks, since they can be less precise instruments. There are dozens of Italian government bonds, but only two futures contracts that trade regularly.



Meanwhile, parts of global bond markets have always had patches of illiquid trading, particularly during bouts of financial-market turbulence.



But investors say that it is getting worse even in these areas, particularly in emerging markets.

For dollar-denominated government debt in emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the median bid-ask spread has risen roughly 75% this year to around 22 cents, according to MarketAxess.

 

Turnover ratios in local-currency emerging-market bondsâ€”which measure trading activity relative to bonds outstandingâ€”have fallen sharply in recent years, according to the Institute of International Finance.



When emerging-market debt sold off in late June, Mr. PradÃ¨re looked to buy Romanian government bonds just when other investors appeared most eager to sell.



But the prices he saw quoted by dealers on his screen were rarely matched by those from actual sellers when he followed up. After a long search, he eventually gave up on the trade.

Other large investors have adjusted their portfolios in part due to weaker liquidity conditions. 



BlueBay Asset Management said lower liquidity has been a reason for caution around crowded trades, while Russell Investments has reduced exposure to investment-grade corporate debt.



The much larger presence of triple-B-rated debt in the marketâ€”the lowest-rated securities still considered investment gradeâ€”means that liquidity may be lower than it currently appears given investors may shun riskier securities during times of market stress, according to Gerard Fitzpatrick, Russell Investmentsâ€™ EMEA chief investment officer. 



â€œWeâ€™ve done some scenario testing there and we think itâ€™s a concern,â€ù Mr. Fitzpatrick said.

Vanguard set the pace with 1,800 commission-free ETFs, while most brokerages say enough is enough



Jul 24, 2018 @ 4:22 pm By Jeff Benjamin 



Commission-free ETF trading appears to be the trend that isn't going away, but TD Ameritrade is the latest company to acknowledge it will not lead in the race to the bottom.



'We're not going to lead [on cutting commissions], but we need to prepare for that downward trend,' said TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. CEO Tim Hockey during a Tuesday earnings call with market analysts.



Asked about the impact of the July 2nd announcement by The Vanguard Group to remove commissions on more than 1,800 exchange-traded funds, Mr. Hockey acknowledged the pressure on TD to stay competitive, but he also put the trend in context.



Of the more than 300 ETFs that TD offers commission-free, Mr. Hockey said, 'five of those ETFs hold 20% of the assets.'



'There does get to a point where it gets to be too much,' he added.



The sentiment was strikingly like the message presented last week during the Charles Schwab Corp. earnings call.



Asked about the pressure to expand its list of commission-free ETFs beyond 265 in the wake on the Vanguard announcement, Schwab president and chief executive Walt Bettinger responded that 'there is a certain level where enough is enough.'



To that, however, Mr. Bettinger added that the list of no-transaction-fee ETFs offered by Schwab will likely be expanded to a 'measurable extent.'



At Fidelity Investments, which offers access to 95 commission-free access, a spokeswoman confirmed 'we're constantly evaluating our offering to ensure we're meeting the needs of our clients.'



Considering the bar set by Vanguard, which beginning next month removes commissions on virtually the entire ETF universe except for leveraged and inverse strategies, the 'enough is enough' response might be all the rest of the industry can do.



Todd Rosenbluth, director and ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, doesn't believe the trend will get to the point where ETF commissions are eliminated entirely, but he does think the trend has some room to run.



'Investors are very cost conscious when choosing ETFs, and the brokerage firms are trying to gather assets and encourage usage of ETFs,' he said. 'By eliminating the hurdle of commissions, it's likely to spur usage.'



According to Schwab's ETF investor study, published last month, commission-free trading ranked as 'extremely important' by 48% of consumers responding to the survey.



The report ranked free ETF trades in the middle of the pack among a list of consumer priorities, but ahead of things like brand name, Morningstar rating and ETF assets.



The Schwab survey of 1,500 ETF investors further showed a growing appeal of commission-free trading.



Of those respondents who ranked free trades as the 'most important' criteria, 31% said they would switch brokerage firms for free ETF trading.



That percentage is up from 23% last year and 17% in 2016.



Even while the market might be pushing toward greater access to commission-free ETFs, Mr. Rosenbluth said the brokerage platforms have also run the numbers and will continue to balance commissions against commission-free trades.



'I don't think commissions are completely going away,' he said. 'From the business perspective, it makes sense to have a select number of commission-free ETFs that are exclusive while the brokerage firm still earns commissions from widely-traded ETFs.'

New report adds fuel to Wall Street's infatuation with company



Jul 24, 2018 @ 4:18 pm



By Bloomberg News 



 

Amazon.com Inc. is well positioned to shake up the asset management industry, according to a new strategy report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.



The Seattle-based company's broad customer base and online platform would give it an edge among big tech companies in asset management, most likely as 'an arms-length distributor of funds' rather than as a 'super-active manager,' Bernstein analysts including Inigo Fraser-Jenkins wrote in a research note Tuesday. They cautioned this is just speculation as there's no sign that Amazon is pursuing asset management at this time. The company didn't reply to an emailed request for comment.



Wall Street's infatuation with Amazon has spread across the market with speculation that the company may dive into sectors like insurance, mortgages or even medical devices. Already this year, Amazon has been a disruptive force for grocery stores, home security and prescription drug distributors. The opportunity is there for fund management with demand for lower-cost financial advice, Bernstein said.



To be sure, the potential foray into the sector wouldn't come without a number of risks. Bernstein thinks the regulatory hoops would be surmountable but the risk to Amazon's reputation if investors lost money would be a bigger challenge to overcome.

Inverted yield curve, often a harbinger of a slowdown, may be pushed by strong expansion 



The inverted yield curve may not be an indicator of a recession--or a sign of declining stock prices. 



By Akane Otani 

July 30, 2018 7:00 a.m. ET 



A decade-old recession predictor is flashing warning signs, but a flattening yield curve doesnâ€™t necessarily portend falling stock prices.



The yield curve, the gap between short- and long-term government bond yields, has narrowed to near 11-year lows in recent months, raising fears the U.S. economy may be headed for a slowdown. Over the last 50 years, a recession has followed every time the yield on two-year Treasurys has exceeded that of 10-year Treasurysâ€”a scenario known as an inverted yield curve.

 

Yet new Credit Suisse CS +0.89% data offer evidence that stocks often continue churning out gains several months after the yield curve inverts. 



The S&P 500 has risen around 16% in the 18 months following an inversion of the curve, going back to 1978, according to a Credit Suisse analysis released this month. Stocks have also managed to push higher over longer time periods, rising an average of 14% in the 24 months following an inversion of the curve and 9.5% in the 30 months afterward.



That pattern suggests the current nine-year bull run is likely to show resilience.



The conventional wisdom surrounding an inverted yield curve stems from two different paths coming together. Investors see longer-term bond yields climbing during strong growth and shorter-term ones rising when monetary policy tightens. When the gap narrow, questions are raised about whether the expansion has run its course.



Several analysts say the recent flattening of the yield curve has mostly been driven by monetary policy and continued growthâ€”and not by fears of an imminent slowdown in expansion.



â€œThe bond market isnâ€™t flashing yellow or red yet,â€ù said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. â€œThe prevailing story here is still that the U.S. is growing pretty nicely.â€ù

 

The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates twice to a range between 1.75% and 2%â€”and signaled it could do so twice more before the end of the yearâ€”citing a robust labor market, steady U.S. growth and signs of long-dormant inflation nudging higher. 



Two-year Treasurys, which tend to be sensitive to monetary-policy expectations, saw their yields climb along with the Fed interest-rate increase and the anticipated ones. 



At the same time, ultralow interest rates outside the U.S., as well as fears that a global trade rift could roil markets, have helped stoke demand and higher prices for longer-term Treasurys.  That pushed those yields lower because yields move inversely to prices in bonds. 



Analysts also note that cracks in the economy that have traditionally accompanied an inverted yield curve havenâ€™t yet surfaced.



Credit Suisseâ€™s analysis found recessions have historically followed not just an inversion of the yield curve, but also a marked deterioration in job creation and corporate earnings, among other factors.



So far, there have been few signs of such weakness. Jobs data from the start of the month showed the U.S. labor market continuing to add jobs at a rapid clip and the unemployment rate hovering around its lowest level in nearly two decades. Corporate earnings have also continued to impress, with S&P 500 firms on track to report year-over-year growth of 20% for the second quarter, according to FactSet.

 

â€œFor me, the principal driver of U.S. equities is U.S. growth, and Iâ€™d say that [second-quarter] data showed a meaningful acceleration,â€ù said Keith Parker, chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS. On Friday, data showed the U.S. economy grew 4.1% in the second quarterâ€”the fastest pace in nearly four years. â€œThat backdrop has held firm.â€ù



Even if the yield curveâ€™s flattening was driven by a sharp dropoff in economic growth, history suggests it would take several months before the nine-year bull market faltered, if it did at all.



For instance, it took 24 months after the yield curve inverted on Dec. 30, 2005, for the U.S. to slip into a recession, according to Credit Suisse. The stock market continued to nudge higher for much of that period, only entering a protracted downturn when the global financial crisis reached a head around the fall of 2008.



The difference in yields between three-month and 10-year Treasurys has been a more reliable predictor in the past of recessions, Credit Suisse says, with the U.S. falling into recession on average 16 months after the former overtook the latterâ€”six months earlier than when the two-year Treasury yield has overtaken the 10-year Treasury yield.



Yet even in those cases, the S&P 500 fell an average of just 2.5% in the 18 months following a yield-curve inversion.



And the current gap between three-month and 10-year Treasurys has remained larger than that of two- and 10-year Treasurysâ€”so that light has yet to start flashing.



â€œThe longer end [of the curve] isnâ€™t reflecting concerns about growth or inflation,â€ù Nuveenâ€™s Mr. Nick said.

The firm is one of the last holdouts to launch CITs, signaling increased demand for the investment vehicle



Aug 3, 2018 @ 1:29 pm

By Greg Iacurci 



Capital Group, the asset manager behind the American Funds investment brand, is planning to offer its target-date mutual funds in a collective-investment-trust-fund vehicle later this year, in a move to seize on the growing popularity of CITs in 401(k) plans.



Capital Group is among the retirement industry's largest and fastest-growing TDF providers, managing $89 billion in target-date mutual-fund assets at the end of 2017, according to Morningstar Inc. The company manages more than $1.8 trillion in total assets worldwide.



It is also one of the 'few big players' that doesn't currently offer collective investment trust funds to 401(k) plans, said Chris Brown, founder and principal of Sway Research, which studies investment distribution in retirement plans. 



Capital Group, along with TIAA Investments and John Hancock Investments â€” respectively the fifth-, ninth-, and twelfth-largest TDFs providers â€” are the only major providers to offer the multi-asset funds in mutual funds only, according to Sway data.



By comparison, other large providers, such as Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price, have made target-date CITs available since 2007-08. 



'We have been following the market very closely and speaking with our clients, and it's clear that there is a growing demand for CITs,' Ralph Haberli, sales director for Capital Group's institutional retirement unit, told InvestmentNews.



A Capital Group spokesman didn't specify the time frame for the CIT launch of its American Funds Target Date Retirement series. He also didn't say whether the firm is planning on making other asset classes available in collective trust funds. 



Advisers and employers have turned to collective trust funds primarily as a way to reduce investment costs, which have become a top concern in an environment of hyper fee sensitivity and increased litigation activity around excessive 401(k) costs. 



The vehicle often yields cost savings when compared with mutual funds because CITs generally have lower operational expenses, are restricted from advertising to the public and don't have to file prospectuses, shareholder reports and proxy statements.



Asset managers focused on active management of their funds, such as Capital Group, have been pressured to reduce fees as index funds, which are often lower in cost, have surged in popularity in 401(k) plans and the broader retail market. 



CITs are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and are only available to retirement plan participants, unlike mutual funds, which are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also available to retail investors.



In the largest 401(k) plans, those with more than $1 billion in assets, collective funds already hold a greater share of assets than mutual funds â€” 40% versus 28%, respectively, according to a study by the Investment Company Institute and BrightScope Inc. Mutual funds still reign as king among smaller plan sizes, but the gap is narrowing. 



Target-date funds have become the most popular investment option in 401(k) plans over the past decade. American Funds as the fastest-growing TDF provider on a percentage basis between 2015 and 2017, with a 58% annual growth rate, according to Sway Research. 



The fund brand saw $24 billion in net positive flows into its TDFs last year, according to Morningstar data. Those flows represented 145% of the firm's total mutual-fund flows in 2017 â€” meaning Capital Group would have seen outflows at the firm level had it not been for the target-date series' growth.

It pays to pay attention to what your brokerage is doing with your cash

When some investment firms say they will treat your money as if it were their own, they mean it â€” all too well.



If the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to make good on its promise to compel brokers to act in their customersâ€™ best interest, it should shine a klieg light on how brokers treat investorsâ€™ cash.



Investors invest, but of course they leave billions in cash in brokerage accounts, too.



At Morgan Stanley, $6.3 billion of that cash is in a money-market mutual fund yielding 1.8%. On Aug. 13, the firm will shut that fund and sweep its clientsâ€™ idle cash into bank accounts that, after a transition period, could yield much less.



As Charles Schwab also did earlier this year, most major brokerages have shoved clients out of money-market funds and into lower yielding bank sweeps, thereby capturing much of the return on customersâ€™ cash for themselves.



In a bank sweep, your brokerage automatically rakes together and deposits your spare cash in one or more banks. Banks hand the brokerage a hefty fee, and the brokerage hands you some crumbs. For any given investor, a few dollars from dividends or interest income donâ€™t amount to much. Rolled together with idle cash from thousands of other investors, they can add up to millions.

 

Even as short-term interest rates have risen to roughly 1.9% from 1.1% over the past year, brokerage firms have barely budged how much they pay on their customersâ€™ cash.



These firms often describe cash sweeps as â€œa low-cost source of funding.â€ù Theyâ€™re not kidding. Youâ€™ve probably never realized how badly you could be getting stiffed: Sweeps often affect only a few dollars at a time, and the disclosures are hard to find, understand and compare.



All this is perfectly legal. Regulations donâ€™t require brokers to pay you anything on your cash, says Paul Clark, a partner in banking and securities law at Seward & Kissel in Washington, D.C.



Most firms declined to comment. Others said most clients keep only a small portion of their portfolios in cash, and all clients are free to select money-market funds or other choices.



Bank sweeps have considerable benefits: federal deposit insurance, instant access to your money, checkwriting, a debit card, online bill payment and the like, all with no fees. A brokerâ€™s profits on sweeps may subsidize other services â€” lowering commissions, for example. Whatâ€™s more, if you just put your money in a bank instead, the bank would also make a fat spread off you â€” with even less disclosure of how much profit it is earning.



The foregone gains arenâ€™t huge. If you hold $10,000 in cash, you could earn about $200 over the next year, at current yields, in a money-market mutual fund. In the average brokerage bank-sweep account, you would make $19, according to Crane Data, a firm in Westboro, Mass., that tracks cash rates.



Yet brokers talk constantly these days about acting in your best interest. Pushing you into sweep accounts that are far more lucrative for them than for you seems inconsistent with that noble goal.



And sweeps are rife with conflicts.



Many brokerage firms sweep your cash into banks their parent company owns. Charles Schwabâ€™s brokerage now deposits all its bank-sweep balances at siblings Schwab Bank and Schwab Signature Bank. â€œIn setting interest rates, the affiliated banks may seek to pay as low a rate as possible,â€ù says a Schwab disclosure.



Some firms, including Wells Fargo Advisors, disclose that the adviser assigned to your account may get paid an incentive fee for steering your cash into a sweep at a sister bank rather than encouraging you to shop elsewhere for better rates.



At Ameriprise Financial, which has $24 billion in cash from clients, revenue from sweeps was up 56% in the first half of 2018 over the same period last year, Chief Executive James Cracchiolo said in a call with analysts on July 25.



According to a recent disclosure from Ameriprise, a bank-deposit account earning 1.9% would cost the firm about 0.1% in service fees. Ameriprise pays its customers 0.13% to 0.14% on balances of less than $250,000. The firm keeps the difference, roughly 1.6%. Ameriprise â€” like many brokerages â€” makes more than 10 times as much on its customersâ€™ cash as they do.



The sweep business is so lucrative that Ameriprise expects to launch its own bank next year, partly to capture the spread for itself, the companyâ€™s management confirmed on the July call.



Brokerage customers at E*Trade Financial Corp. averaged $37.9 billion in sweep deposits in the first half of 2018, according to the companyâ€™s latest earnings release. The firm lists 29 banks where it may deposit cash sweeps, and its disclosures say it relies on an outside providerâ€™s â€œallocation algorithmâ€ù and â€œobjective processâ€ù to distribute cash among those banks. Yet E*Trade has deposited 92% of its customersâ€™ sweeps at siblings E*Trade Bank and E*Trade Savings Bank, according to its latest earnings release.



For the full year 2017, at the 0.01% yield E*Trade was then paying on cash, it paid all its customers combined only $4 million in interest on sweep deposits, according to the firmâ€™s annual report.



In March, E*Trade began raising the yield on its sweeps. Customers are now earning 0.15% on cash balances between $100,000 and $499,999.



Investors with sweep accounts at the brokerage division of LPL Financial Holdings earn 0.16% on a $250,000 balance. LPL, meanwhile, is making roughly 1.85% on its customersâ€™ cash, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Audette said on a call with analysts and investors on July 26.



Cash sweeps contributed 25% of LPLâ€™s total gross profit in the second quarter, nearly as much as LPLâ€™s commission and advisory fees combined, according to a financial presentation by the firm.



At Raymond James Financial, clients have $41 billion in bank sweep accounts, of which 46% resides at Raymond James Bank â€” up from 37% a year ago. â€œMore and more of the client sweep cash has been directed to our bank as opposed to outside banks,â€ù Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Julien said in a conference call on July 26.



Part of the problem is inconsistent and incomplete disclosure. Some brokerages say how much they are taking in fees; some disclose the maximum they could take. Some disclose they will sweep all your cash to banking affiliates; some donâ€™t clearly state that their sibling banks get first dibs on your dough. Regulators could do more to make these disclosures informative.



The bottom line: Brokerages are getting rich on your money. You have the right to change how they handle your cash, and you should.

No standard definition exists, meaning â€˜even a dirty-brown corporate can carve out a deal that looks greenâ€™ 



By Mike Bird and Manju Dalal 

Aug. 19, 2018 2:30 p.m. ET 



The booming world of â€œgreen bondsâ€ù faces a credibility problem: Definitions can be so fuzzy that environmentally conscious investors might end up funding fossil-fuel power stations. 



Green bonds are securities that help companies and governments fund initiatives such as renewable-power projects and energy-efficiency programs. This is turning into one of the worldâ€™s fastest-growing asset classes: Issuance of such securities ran to around $161 billion last year, up from around $10 billion in 2013. 



But not all green bonds are equal. The Climate Bonds Initiative, a London-based not-for-profit, acts as a de facto watchdog for the market. In the past two years it has excluded hundreds of bonds marketed as green or environmentally friendly from its index, rejecting $24.5 billion of $114.2 billion in issuance this year.



CBI might reject bonds because they donâ€™t give enough detail about how proceeds will be deployed, or because the funds raised donâ€™t contribute to the goal of the Paris Agreement: to keep the increase in global temperatures this century to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. 

 

The most egregious bonds labeled as â€œgreenâ€ù are found in China and other developing countries, critics say, disparaging them as â€œbrown,â€ù or environmentally unfriendly. 



Taiwan Power Co., a state-owned electricity provider, has in recent months marketed two bond deals totaling $271 million as â€œgreen.â€ù The CBI rejected both because proceeds would help upgrade gas and coal power stations. Taiwan Power didnâ€™t respond to a request for comment.



â€œWe really need to improve the definition of what it means to be a green bond as right now, even a dirty-brown corporate can carve out a deal that looks green,â€ù said Andrew Jackson, head of fixed income at Hermes Investment Management in London.



The challenges exemplify a broader issue: Definitions can be a problem across the burgeoning market for environmental, social and governance-driven investing. 



Companies that sell bonds labeled â€œgreenâ€ù are often responding to favorable treatment of the securities. 



In China, for example, banks can borrow at advantageous terms from the central bank using green bonds issued by banks as collateral, when similar nongreen bonds wouldnâ€™t be accepted. Issuers can also win fast-tracked approval to sell new debt.



Even in developed economies, funds and issuers differ on what constitutes a green bond. The European Commission, the European Unionâ€™s executive arm, is working on definitions of green assets. But it wonâ€™t produce strict certifications for green bonds, leaving room for continued leeway in interpretation.



Forty-five percent of so-called green bonds in emerging markets would be ineligible for the BNP Paribas Asset Management funds dedicated to such securities compared with 22% in developed economies, according to the firm.



â€œThe lack of shame among issuers is alarming,â€ù said L. Bryan Carter, head of emerging-markets debt investing at the firm. â€œThey are deaf to the idea that if youâ€™re raising $1 billion for green investments, I need to know youâ€™re spending it on green investments.â€ù



Comparing such bonds is difficult, according to credit-ratings firm Moodyâ€™s Investors Service: Green bonds sold by different countries use different frameworks to measure outcomes, such as the carbon emissions saved.



Electricity company Innogy SE is another example of the potential problems. Some Innogy assets currently owned by German energy company RWE AG are set to be acquired by rival E.ON SE. The deal will likely involve transferring a green bond. 



Analysts at research firm CreditSights say the purchaser has little interest in green financing, and the â‚¬850 million ($970 million) bond might simply become a regular bond. 



E.ON declined to comment. Innogy said the bond, which is likely to be split off from the wind projects it finances, could keep its green status if it were reallocated to other environmentally friendly projects, but it couldnâ€™t give guidance on whether that would happen.



Numerous securities excluded from the CBIâ€™s index pop up in funds with an environmental focus, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Thomson Reuters data. 



Funds managed by Luxembourg-based von der Heydt Invest SA and Amundi Asset Management SA hold at least four bonds excluded by the CBI, while a fund managed by Swiss private bankLombard Odier holds at least five, the data show. Funds run by BNP Paribas Asset Management and U.S.-based Calvert Research and Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. , held at least one excluded bond. 



Some of the securities might fit into other categories of socially focused investing, for instance bonds helping fund cheap loans to coffee farmers. And the data didnâ€™t show any of the fund managers holding, for example, either of the Taiwan Power bonds.



Many of the asset managers said they have stringent procedures for screening securities, which differ from the CBI methodology but are in line with the International Capital Market Associationâ€™s green-bond principles.



â€œWe look at [the CBIâ€™s list] as an input,â€ù said Vishal Khanduja, one of the managers of the Calvert Green Bond Fund. He compared the process to credit ratings. â€œI would not just assume a bond rated by an agency was AAA: I would do my own workâ€_and make my own decisions,â€ù he said.



BNP Paribas, Lombard Odier and Amundi also said they did their own analyses. Von der Heydt Invest didnâ€™t respond to a request for comment.



Even so, confusion over the green-bond label remains a problem, some say. â€œYouâ€™ve got competing indexes, competing standards. Itâ€™s the kind of thing that limits the marketâ€™s efficiency and scale,â€ù said Josh Olazabal, senior analyst for environmental, social and governance-focused investing at CreditSights. For debt buyers, he said, this â€œleads to hesitation and uncertainty and risk.â€ù

Smart Saver intends to help investors use extra cash to take advantage of rising interest rates



Aug 17, 2018 @ 5:36 pm By Ryan W. Neal  



Betterment has a new, low-risk portfolio aimed at helping clients take advantage of rising interest rates. 



The new Smart Saver feature, quietly announced on the robo adviser's blog, lets Betterment investors move extra cash sitting in checking and savings accounts into a selection of bonds â€” 80% U.S. short-term treasury bonds (SHV) and 20% U.S. short-term investment bonds (NEAR). 



Betterment projects the Smart Saver portfolio will yield 2% before it collects its management fee, and roughly 1.8% after fees. Certainly an improvement over the unwavering low interest rates many bank accounts deliver. 



On social media, some pointed out that the yield is still lower than interest rates at several high-yield bank accounts. Marcus, the new high-yield savings account from Goldman Sachs, offers 1.85% rates. 



Betterment's director of behavioral finance and investments Dan Egan responded that unlike bank accounts, which likely won't increase rates over time, the bond yields in the Smart Saver portfolio are structured to increase along with the federal funds rate. And because the underlying funds are U.S. government bonds, the earnings are not subject to state and local taxes. 



'There is a zero-sum game between you and your bank with interest rates,' Mr. Egan said, adding that Betterment is incentivized to deliver the highest yield possible with lowest risk in Smart Saver accounts. 



Meb Faber, the co-founder and chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management, tweeted that he loves the idea and that it 'more than makes up for the management fee.' 

'It may not be peak optimal but I think it's 10x better than what 90% of people currently do, which is to get 0%,' he said. 



Smart Saver is a taxable account that is not FDIC-insured like a bank account. But Mr. Egan said that because all of the products in the portfolio are bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, both rely on confidence in the solvency and stability of the U.S. federal government. 



Others pointed out that Smart Saver is a clever way for Betterment to keep client assets on the robo-adviser platform if they decide to pull out of the stock market. 



It's an increasing area of focus for digital financial startups as the bull market gets longer in the tooth. SoFi launched Money, a hybrid checking and savings account, while Wealthfront reportedly surveyed users to gauge interest in cash accounts. 



The feature will also be available on the white-label version of the robo-adviser, Betterment for Advisors.

By Bradley Saacks August 27, 2018 



The T shareâ€™s onetime biggest supporter is not planning on launching the share class on its platform any time soon.



Wells Fargo â€œmade plans to use T shares in brokerage retirement accounts but eventually decided against it,â€ù a company spokeswoman writes in an e-mail.



â€œAlthough we could offer them in the future, we have no current plans to do so,â€ù the spokeswoman says.



The T share gained prominence in the industry when firms were preparing to comply with the Department of Laborâ€™s fiduciary rule. With its uniform 2.5% load and 25-basis-point 12b-1 fee, the share class was meant to eliminate conflicts of interest for advisors. It was labeled by many in the industry as a transitional share class that would be a bridge to an eventual clean-share model. 



Wells Fargo was the only major distributor to commit to using the share class to comply with the now-vacated Department of Labor fiduciary rule, as other broker-dealers who were still allowing their advisors to use brokerage IRAs, such as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Raymond James, had planned to use the Best Interest Contract Exemption. 



Even after the DOL regulation was delayed last year, Wells said it would stick to its plan of launching T shares on its platform, but it was slowed by a technical systems issue. The firm had not yet launched the share class when the regulation was officially vacated by an appellate court in March.



The share class has taken on a new life recently as a brokerage share class for interval funds. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management accepts T shares on at least one Blackstone interval fund, filings have shown. 



Wellsâ€™s T-share policy is another example in a string of broker-dealer compliance fixes spurred by the DOL rule that have fallen by the wayside. LPL Financial has put its mutual fundâ€“only platform â€œon hold,â€ù while Merrill Lynch is reviewing its brokerage IRA ban. Commonwealth Financial is allowing advisors to operate in commission-based retirement accounts. 



UBS has been the broker-dealer most often connected with clean shares, which have several definitions in the industry but have been incredibly popular for both sales teams and product development groups. The firm is expected to roll out clean shares that include built-in subâ€“transfer agent charges in the second quarter of 2019.
