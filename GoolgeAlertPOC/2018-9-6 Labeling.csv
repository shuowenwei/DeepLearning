title,url,source,Interesting,Risk,ContentAsian shares mostly lower after topsy-turvy day on Wall St,https://wtop.com/national/2018/05/us-stocks-edge-lower-as-pfizer-and-under-armour-sink/,https://wtop.com,No,Market,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares are mixed in Asia after a topsy-turvy May Day session on Wall Street, where most benchmarks recovered from early losses as Apple led a rally in technology companies.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.3 percent to 22,444.09 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.6 percent to 30,622.73. The Shanghai Composite index shed 0.4 percent to 3,070.45 and South Korea’s Kospi gave up 0.4 percent to 2,506.55. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 advanced 0.5 percent to 6,045.70. Shares were lower in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.

WALL STREET: U.S. stocks clawed back early losses Tuesday as the rally in technology and smaller, domestically-focused companies helped offset a slump in household goods makers and industrial companies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 354 points, then recovered to close down 64. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3 percent to 2,654.80. The Dow slipped 0.3 percent to 24,099, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 0.9 percent to 7,130.55. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 0.5 percent to 1,550.33.




TRADE: Top trade officials from the U.S. are due to meet in Beijing with senior Chinese leaders to discuss ways to defuse worsening tensions over the trade imbalance. The Trump administration decision Monday to delay a decision on imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports sidesteps a potential trade battle with Europe for now, but European Union leaders want a permanent exemption and say the uncertainty caused by delays is bad for business.

ANALYST’S VIEWPOINT: “The optimism stemming from the delay of metal tariffs in the U.S. … appears to have dissipated into today’s session with trade tensions also looming ahead. As investors look ahead to the meeting between US and Chinese delegates into the end of the week, both the trade and commerce representatives in the U.S. spoke of challenges,” Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.

U.S. ECONOMY: U.S. manufacturing grew at a slower pace in April, according to the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers. Many factories said shortages of workers and skills affected their productivity. Meanwhile the Commerce Department said construction spending fell in March as home building dropped sharply.

SAMSUNG BIOLOGICS: South Korean biotech company Samsung Biologics Co.’s shares plunged as much as 11 percent in Seoul after a regulator said Samsung breached accounting rules. Samsung said it will defend itself and has abided by accounting rules. At stake is whether or not the way Samsung Biologics evaluated the value of its affiliate Samsung Bioepis violated rules.

ENERGY: Overnight, oil prices gave up some of their recent gains. But they bounced back Wednesday in Asia, with benchmark U.S. crude gaining 27 cents to $67.52 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 1.9 percent to $67.25 a barrel in New York on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, added 7 cents to $73.20 per barrel. It dropped 2.1 percent to $73.13 a barrel in London.

CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 109.74 Japanese yen from 109.88 yen. The euro rose to $1.2004 from $1.1993.
"Charles Schwab: Tax-Loss Harvesting Trades Up in Volatile Market,https://www.investopedia.com/news/charles-schwab-taxloss-harvesting-trades-volatile-market/,https://www.investopedia.com,No,Fraud,"Volatility is back with a vengeance, and as a result, so is tax-loss harvesting. While many think this tax-smart strategy is only a fourth quarter move, with stocks whipsawing between up and down days throughout the year, Charles Schwab's David Koenig, chief investment strategist for Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, said there are lots of opportunities to pair winning stocks with losing ones to offset capital gains outside of the end of the year.

""It's really designed to take advantage of the natural volatility in the market throughout the year,"" said  Koenig in an interview with Investopedia. In 2017, when volatility was low and stocks were setting new highs seemingly every month, there were fewer opportunities to engage in tax-loss harvesting. But with volatility rising in 2018, the ability to implement this tax savings strategy has increased. ""In early February, around the time of the correction, the number of tax-loss harvesting trades made for clients jumped significantly,"" said Koenig. ""That said, we also had tax-loss harvesting trades for clients in 2017 and every month since 2015. Periods of higher volatility present more opportunity.""

[Check out Investopedia's TD Ameritrade review to learn about this low-cost broker with powerful charting tools.]

When it comes to tax-loss harvesting, there are rules that investors have to be aware of such as the wash sale rule. Under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, investors can't claim a tax loss on a stock they sold and then repurchased within 30 days. The IRS looks at all of the investor's holdings to determine if he or she broke the rule, and if it finds that one stock sale/purchase did so, it will be disallowed. Furthermore, while it can be easy to spot winners and losers in stock portfolios, it can get tougher to identify those opportunities for ETF investors.

To aid in that and to prevent clients from running afoul of the wash sale rule, the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio will do the work for clients, using algorithms that automatically check every portfolio each day for rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting opportunities. Take a large-cap U.S. stock exchange-traded fund (ETF) as an example. If that ETF has a big enough decline, it will be sold off to offset any capital gains for the year. To prevent the client from losing exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks during the 30 days that the IRS doesn't allow repurchase of that same ETF, Schwab Intelligent Portfolio will invest in another ETF that gives the client the same exposure but doesn't run afoul of the wash sale rules.

""It's a great feature for taxable account clients,"" said the executive from The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW). ""It's a strategy that hasn't been readily available to individual investors in the past.""

"Comprehensive Stock Analysis – Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) [google.com] ,http://stocksmarketcap.com/,http://stocksmarketcap.com/,No,,None"Record YoY Fee Decline in 2017 Driven by Vanguard, Discount Brokerages: Morningstar",https://www.investopedia.com/news/record-yoy-fee-decline-2017-driven-vanguard-discount-brokerages-morningstar/,,Yes,Liquidity,"Expenses on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds saw their steepest year-over-year decline in 2017 thanks to Vanguard and rivals Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and BlackRock, all of which stepped up the fee reductions in 2017.

According to Morningstar, the asset-weighted average expense ratio across funds was 0.52% in 2017, marking an 8% year-over-year decline. Morningstar said in a report that this marked the steepest year-over-year decline since the company started tracking asset-weighted average fees in 2000. As a result of the fee reductions, Morningstar estimates that investors saved around $4 billion in expenses in 2017 alone. The fund ranking company noted that funds with expense ratios that were above 1.10% accounted for under 10% of the assets invested in U.S. equity funds last year.

[Check out Investopedia's TD Ameritrade review to learn about this low-cost broker with powerful charting tools.]

Breaking it down into categories, Morningstar found that the asset-weighted average fee for U.S. equity funds declined 9% to 0.45% last year, while taxable bond funds saw asset-weighted average fees decline 7% to 0.44%, and international equity funds saw fees decline 8% to 0.64%.

""Declines in the asset-weighted average fees were more pronounced among passively managed funds thanks to strong flows into the lowest-cost funds, as well as fee cuts by some asset managers for widely held broad index funds,"" wrote Morningstar. ""In aggregate, passively managed funds exhibited asset-weighted expense ratio declines of 7% from 2016. International equity funds exhibited the largest declines among passive funds, whose asset-weighted average fees fell 9% to reach 0.23%.""

On the active side, the decline in fees was driven by large outflows from pricey funds and large inflows into cheaper ones. What's more, last year, more actively managed funds lowered their fees, resulting in asset-weighted fees for actively managed funds declining 4%. It marked the largest year-over-year dip in more than 10 years.

Summary


•This is an educational article regarding the process of finding and selecting under-priced fixed-income securities that trade on the stock exchange.

•It argues for using relative valuation when making a buy recommendation on a particular fixed-income security.

•BofI Holding's 6.25% Subordinated Notes maturing on 2/28/2026 are used as a case study in using relative valuation to find a very undervalued fixed-income security.


Overview

In the world of fixed-income investing, there is no objective value, only relative value. There is no interest rate (yield) that one can say is right for a particular security. For example, preferred stocks currently sell at yields that aren't much different from yields that existed when the 10-Year Treasury yield was half of what it is now. So are preferred stocks overpriced now or were they underpriced when the 10-Year Treasury had a significantly lower yield?

My major gripe regarding some Seeking Alpha authors who promote fixed-income ideas (preferred stocks or bonds) is that they use an objective valuation approach rather than a relative valuation approach in their security selection process. They provide information about the company that issued the fixed-income security that they are promoting, and about the details of the fixed-income security that they write about (yield, price, call date), and expect that is enough to make an investment decision. However, no evidence is provided that their recommended security is a relatively better value than other similar securities issued by other similar companies. Sometimes I find the recommendations to be relatively overpriced and inferior.

Tips For Finding and Selecting Undervalued Fixed-Income Securities

1) One of the lessons I have learned from my 20 years of trading fixed-income securities is that the best values are in unrated fixed-income securities. You can generally get preferred stock and baby bond safety ratings from Moody's and S&P from QuantumOnline.com, but when checking safety ratings at QuantumOnline, you will discover that a large number of fixed-income securities are not rated. This only means that the company has decided not to pay the rating agencies to rate their fixed-income securities. But many unrated securities are extremely safe. Despite this fact, many mutual funds and other institutional investors have instructions not to buy unrated securities. Therefore, unrated securities are often underpriced due to lack of buying from ""big money"" and the fact that they are avoided by those who do not want to take the time (or have the knowledge) to examine the safety of the company themselves. In my opinion, it is well worth taking the time to look into unrated securities as you will greatly outperform the benchmarks by finding the unrated gems. Learning the basics of reading a balance sheet will go a long way in becoming a successful fixed-income investor.


2) For companies that are rated smaller companies tend to receive lower ratings simply because they are small despite the fact that they may have better balance sheets and better business prospects than more highly rated companies. So bargains tend to exist more in the fixed-income securities issued by smaller companies.

3) For ""stock exchange traded"" bonds, there may be bonds issued by the same company that trade on the ""bond exchange"". This gives you a chance to see if there is a relative mispricing between the company's exchange traded bonds and the company's bond exchange traded bonds. A couple of examples of this are comparing the ""stock exchange traded"" PSEC 2024 bonds (PBB) with the many PSEC bonds that trade on the ""bond exchange"". Right now PBB looks like a good relative value. An extreme mispricing can be found when comparing the R.R. Donnelley (NASDAQ:RRD) trust security (PYS) which contains the same R.R. Donnelley bonds that trade on the ""bond exchange"" - the 6.625% bonds maturing 2029. PYS is extremely underpriced relative to the identical ""bond exchange"" traded bond. Bonds traded on the stock exchange are often better values than those traded on the bond exchange, and they are also often more liquid and easier to trade.

4) This article mainly focuses on bonds. For more information on evaluating preferred stocks to find mispriced bargains, see some of my recent Seeking Alpha articles here, here, and here where relative valuation is used to document the mispriced preferred stock bargains. Additionally, one important thing you can do in evaluating preferred stocks is to look at the yield on the bonds that have been issued by the same company to help get an idea of safety of the company and the relative valuation of the preferred stock versus the bond.

Markets around the globe pulled back Monday, as concerns surrounding trade tensions continued. Last week, China said it was ready to retaliate with tariffs on around $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, amid a mounting trade war with the States. Beijing added that import taxes would be within the range of 5 percent to 25 percent in rates, with many of the goods listed linked to agriculture.

The U.S. administration revealed last Wednesday that President Donald Trump had spoken with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and asked him to consider increasing the proposed levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods up to 25 percent, from 10 percent.

Markets in Asia and Europe came under slight pressure on Monday morning, as investors awaited more news on the retaliatory tariffs.

While no major speeches by the U.S. Federal Reserve are scheduled to take place Monday, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard spoke with CNBC on the first trading day of the week.

""The positioning here is that the other countries are all free trade and the U.S. is not. If that's really what we're saying then just drop all tariffs and all non-tariff barriers. Go down to zero. That would be better outcome for the whole world,"" Bullard told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

The U.S. government reported on Friday that payroll growth slowed in July.

According to the latest World Bank data, life expectancy in India has risen from 53-54 years in 1980 to 67-70 years in 2015. Living longer has a direct impact on your financial preparedness for retirement. While many will have an accumulated pension to fall back on, the truth is an annual price rise or inflation of 5-6% combined with the prospect of potentially living for another 20-25 years post retirement can become an expensive outcome.

A basic need for retirees is regular income. You need to take that accumulated pension amount, other savings you have piled up over the years and assets you have created and make them into a viable stream of regular income.






Large expenses like medical contingencies need to be accounted for before you estimate your regular income need, else these expenses can eat into your retirement savings. “We find that many who retire haven’t planned any medical insurance. With health costs rising, this is a risk that needs to be covered. If both spouses are not fit enough for mediclaim application to be accepted, the one who can should cover medical expenses through a policy. In its absence, a larger pool of funds will have to be kept aside for medical emergencies,” said Vivek Rege, founder and chief executive, VR Wealth Advisors Pvt. Ltd.

Financial savings and assets

Among traditional investment choices for senior citizens are bank fixed deposits, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) and National Savings Certificate (NSC). Bank FDs give senior citizens an advantage by giving an interest rate that is 25-50 basis points higher than what other individuals get. The 8.3% interest on SCSS is also attractive. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.






After allocating to traditional investments and pension plans which cater to capital preservation, consider mutual fund investments as well—they are liquid, they help you get regular payouts and let you access the lump sum in case of any emergency. For debt funds, your holding period can be between 6 months and 3 years, equity and balanced funds will require you to remain invested for at least 5 years.

Yogita Dand, Mumbai-based certified financial planner and co-founder, AskY Financial Services, said, “Invest in SCSS and Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana, in which you can invest up to _ 15 lakh. With the rest, create systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs) from investments in large-cap equity or balanced funds.” An SWP from an equity-oriented fund works if you have invested in equity before and have accumulated profits. Given the need for capital preservation post retirement, if one does not have any equity exposure, then SWP should be done from short-term income funds or other fixed income funds that give stable returns.

Physical assets

Traditionally, most Indian families invest in a house. In many cases, people own a house but have inadequate cash flow to meet their expenses or lifestyle, but still do not want to move to a new smaller house or on rent. For such persons, there is reverse mortgage.

To opt for reverse mortgage, you must be the home owner and above 60 years of age. It’s like mortgaging your house to the bank, and getting a loan which comes to you as regular payouts. The eligibility depends on age, value of the property, interest rates and tenure of payout. The tenure can be for up to 20 years; the longer the tenure, the lower will be the payout. 






Punjab National Bank, for example, pays _ 435 per lakh per month and _ 101 per lakh per month for a tenure of 10 and 20 years, respectively. For a _ 80 lakh loan, this will come to a monthly payout of _ 34,800 for 10 years and _ 8,080 for 20 years. The current rate is about 11.35% per annum, and is revised every five years.

Even if the tenure gets exhausted, you can continue living in the house. On death, legal heirs can keep the house by repaying the loan with interest. Else, bank can sell the house to recover the dues and pay the remaining to the legal heirs.

It’s been a decade since reverse mortgage was introduced in India, but there are few takers for it. “There is lack of awareness, neither the government nor the lenders ever tried to make it popular. Low payout, lack of understanding and complex process of borrowing are other deterrents,” said Manoj Pandey, director, Mainstream Investments Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Delhi-based financial planning and wealth management firm. 

What you should do

Remember that structuring a SWP, choosing appropriate funds or even deciding to go for a reverse mortgage is not simple.

Your mix of fixed-return products like FDs, small savings schemes and annuities and market-linked products like debt and equity mutual funds will depend on your existing savings pile and your need for capital preservation. 






Also, fixed return products work best if you are in the 10% or 20% income tax bracket. For those paying 30% plus income tax, a mix of mutual funds is more efficient. Don’t lock all your money in locked-in products like deposits, bonds and annuities.
"AxeTrading Looks To Expand,https://www.marketsmedia.com/axetrading-looks-to-expand/,https://www.marketsmedia.com/,No,Market,"AxeTrading, which provides fixed income trading technology, is aiming to expand in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America over the next year as more buy-side firms adopt the firm’s execution management system.

The firm launched in 2009 and is focused on providing an EMS for asset managers who have been forced to become less reliant on liquidity from the sellside and are also increasingly looking to participate in an all-to-all trading model, where they have to make prices.

Mark Watters, CCO and co-founder of AxeTrading, told Markets Media: “In the next 12 months we expect to open an office in North America, continue to expand in Asia Pacific and hopefully have our first customer in Latin America. In addition, a number of buy-side firms are expected to have adopted our EMS for fixed income.”

He added that three large asset managers recently chose AxeTrading’s fixed income EMS rather than adapting their equities platform. Axe Trading has also been targeting emerging markets and fixed income firms who are likely to become more prominent as regional players.

For example, South African’s Nedbank became the first bank to transact on the country’s new ‘ETP’ government bond electronic trading platform which went live on July 18. Nedbank and several other ETP participant banks use AxeTrader, the firm’s flagship platform.


Mark Watters, AxeTrading

“In South Africa we pitched to five local banks who did not have their own fixed income systems and four took our solution,” added Watters.

MiFID II

In Europe MiFID II, which came into force at the start of this year, extended best execution requirements from equities into fixed income for the first time. Watters thinks the real technical response to MiFID II is only just beginning.

“For example, one of our clients has just decided to become a systematic internaliser and so needs a new technology solution,” he said.

MiFID II prohibits broker crossing networks and requires firms to set up systematic internalisers in order to commit capital. More than 100 SIs have registered in fixed income which has led to increased fragmentation and complexity as investors need to navigate more venues and trading protocols. AxeTrader provides banks, broker-dealers and buy-side firms with an aggregated view of of fixed income liquidity including axes, runs and quotes from the electronic venues, messaging platforms and voice channels used by a client.

“More MiFID II data is beginning to emerge and clients are discussing APIs, how to use data and how to integrate data into their workflow which will feed into the best execution process,” added Watters. “These conversations were not happening to such an extent even in January and February this year.”

As a result of the increased regulatory requirements under MiFID II, AxeTrading signed a technology partnership with BGC Partners in April this year for the broker to extend its use of AxeTrader across a number of its agency businesses.

The firm said in a statement at the time: “The move comes as BGC Partners extends its regulatory compliance, with immediate attention to the cross-asset best-execution requirements of its agency brokerage businesses under MiFID II, which came into effect on 3 January 2018.”

Last year AxeTrading received a strategic investment of €2m ($2.4m)  from Illuminate Financial Management, the venture capital firm which funds fintech companies in capital markets that create change through providing solutions for cost, control, capital efficiency or compliance with regulations.

Fragmentation

Consultancy Aite Group said in a report, Best Execution, Fragmentation, and Data: Fixed Income’s Cerberus, that the fragmentation of fixed income liquidity has reached an all-time high with the proliferation of electronic venues heading to nearly 150.

Audrey Blater, Ph.D., author of the report, explained in the report that Cerberus is a three-headed dog that guards the underworld to prevent the dead from leaving.


Audrey Blater, Aite Group

“While no such beast exists in reality, best execution, fragmentation, and data have become three pain points in today’s bond markets that prevent full transparency – the Cerberus of fixed income,” she added. “While best execution practices are required by regulators, collecting, cleaning, and aggregating supportive data can be incredibly challenging for illiquid securities.”

She cited Bill De Leon, managing director and global head of portfolio risk management at asset manager Pimco, who spoke at the Fixed Income Leaders Summit in Boston in June. De Leon said that global firms need to normalize various types of data across multiple platforms to achieve best execution.

“He points to the presence of data accessibility, such as granular tick data, for the analysis of US Treasuries and futures but asserts that beyond these instruments, fixed income data is sparse and difficult,” she wrote. “Thus, managing information and data becomes a big problem – firms have many products and many people executing, and have to be sure that what’s being done is meaningful.”

Blater continued that the MiFID II measure of liquid bonds has fallen short of expectations and Trace, the US reporting system for bond trading,  remains a good but imperfect vessel. Therefore, the sellside is being asked to step in and provide clients with superior market and evaluative data.

“This will foster the transaction cost analysis and data provider arms race—which is only won by offering cutting-edge technology, seamless integration, and custom client solutions,” Blater added.

Slams Schwab With $100M Defamation Suit,https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/1070282/investment-co-slams-schwab-with-100m-defamation-suit,https://www.law360.com/,Yes,Liquidity,"Law360 (August 6, 2018, 3:28 PM EDT) -- A Texas investment adviser hit Charles Schwab Corp. with a $100 million defamation suit, claiming the national investment firm poached its clients after terminating their working relationship because of false stories alleging the adviser colluded with President Donald Trump, Russians and Fox News to publish “fake news.”

Chapwood Capital Investment Management LLC told the Eastern District of Texas Friday that Charles Schwab terminated an “excellent” business relationship that had been in place since 2008 after NPR published a story accusing Chapwood founder Ed Butowsky of working with Fox News, Russian agents and the White House to “concoct” a story alleging that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich had leaked emails to WikiLeaks in 2016 and was murdered over it.

 After the story was published in August 2017, Chapwood claims Charles Schwab started contacting Chapwood’s current and former clients, telling them it planned to end its relationship with Chapwood. The emails and letters did not state Schwab’s reasoning, leaving the implication that the NPR story was true and Chapwood was no longer trustworthy because of it, Chapwood said.

“In letters baked full of half-truths and insinuations of malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance, Schwab painted Chapwood and its principals as unethical, dishonest and untrustworthy,” Chapwood said. “The insinuation and implication was clear — there was a real problem, an immediate danger, and clients and former clients needed to be constantly warned about Chapwood.”

Chapwood claims it lost nearly 270 accounts and $45 million in assets under management as a result of Charles Schwab’s actions.

 Shortly after the article was published, Charles Schwab contacted Chapwood to request a conference call to discuss Butowsky’s “political views and Trump,” but the call never happened. Instead, the email writing-campaign started, and Chapwood did not learn about the impending termination of the business relationship until after emails had been sent to its clients, according to the complaint.

 Chapwood claims Charles Schwab knew the story was false, but secretly planned to use the story as a way to defame Chapwood and poach its clients.

“The suggestion that the President of the United States and the “Russians” (Vladimir Putin) would have colluded with Butowsky — a person unknown to either the president or Putin and with whom neither the president nor Putin has ever communicated — was preposterous,” Chapwood said.

 The emails, which Chapwood said were sent in violation of the agreement between the firms, did not include Schwab’s political reasoning for terminating the relationship, leaving through omission the implication that the NPR story was true, according to the complaint.

“The letters were carefully written and crafted to deceive Chapwood’s clients and to cause them to question Chapwood and Butowsky’s honesty and integrity,” Chapwood said.

 In the nearly 10 years the companies worked together, the relationship was “excellent” and there had been no customer complaints, Chapwood claimed, making it clear that the reason for terminating the agreement was the false narrative about Butowsky’s alleged collusion.

 In addition to losing clients and assets, Chapwood went through the “painful” process of finding another broker-dealer and custodian for client assets, as the unexplained termination “caused endless embarrassing and unanswerable questions,” with many companies rejecting Chapwood, according to the complaint.

“The defendants’ acts and omissions cast aspersion on Chapwood and Butowsky’s honesty, credit, efficiency, prestige and standing in the investment advisory business,” Chapwood said. “Chapwood and Butowsky endured insult, humiliation, embarrassment and injury to their names and reputations because of the defendants’ letters and published statements.”

A spokesperson for Charles Schwab said in an email that the company terminated its relationship with Chapwood on Jan. 22 under the terms of its agreement with the firm, and the termination came after a thorough business review. The spokesperson added the company does not publicly discuss details of its business reviews.

 Representatives for Chapwood could not immediately be reached for comment Monday morning.

 Chapwood and Butowsky are represented by Steven S. Biss of Law Office of Steven S. Biss and Ty Clevenger, Esq. of Ty Odell Clevenger, Attorney At Law.

 Counsel information for Charles Schwab was not available.

 The case is Chapwood Capital Investment Management, LLC et al. v. Charles Schwab Corporation et al., case number 4:18-cv-00548, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

Summary


•Fidelity finally sets the bar at zero.

•Indexing - The Death Star.

•Wealth Management vs. Money Management - a Key Difference.


Fidelity Investments has finally done it. The large Boston-based fund manager recently cut the management fees on two of their index-oriented stock mutual funds to zero - nada - NOTHING. Their arch-rival Vanguard Group pioneered cheap, index-based investing in 1974. Forty-four years later, after decades of competitive innovation, fee-cutting and marketing hocus between Fidelity, Vanguard, and third rival Charles Schwab, we've reached a crossroads in the industry. Money management is officially a free service! How can Fidelity (or anyone) make money at zero? Could fees actually go below zero in the future? Where is the ""value add"" in the investment industry today? What about so-called ""wealth managers""? What's their place in the industry? With this latest news from Fidelity, these are a few of the key questions facing providers and clients alike. We've got a few tentative answers.

First, on the matter of whether money managers can be profitable without charging fees, the answer is… it depends. Large players (like the Big Three mentioned above) can generally make it work because of two things - scale economies and securities lending. Schwab and Fidelity, for example, have custody of trillions of dollars in stocks and bonds. They can lend your Boeing or Exxon shares to short-sellers in return for fees. Likewise, Vanguard can sell and later repurchase your Treasury bonds from a hedge fund in return for interest payments. In this way (and others), large securities portfolios (portfolios technically ""owned"" by customers) generate material levels of income - enough to cover the cost of running an index fund, for example.

Remember, in money management as in most personal service businesses, costs are mostly people costs. Substituting a rote equity index and a computer program for the (well paid) people formerly managing the money can generate big savings. This is one of the secrets of the Big Three, and they're making it work - for themselves and millions of retail investors. In the future, the benefits of automation will continue to flow, and as competition between the big players continues to heat up, there's no practical reason that fees can't go negative, at least for short periods. Imagine being paid by your money manager for the privilege of handing him your nest egg! Cry no tears for your Big Three custodian, however; they're making it up on the securities lending

Spreadbetters pointed to a tentative start for European shares with futures for London's FTSE up 0.07 percent. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were up 0.08 percent. 





Chinese shares turned negative with the blue-chip share index and Shanghai's SSE Composite down more than 1 percent each. Japan's Nikkei and South Korea's Kospi index slipped 0.1 percent.

Among the gainers, Australian shares added 0.6 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.5 percent.

The trade dispute remains a live issue for markets with China proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict. 

That was followed by a report in China's state media saying Friday's retaliatory tariffs were ""rational"" while accusing the United States of blackmail. 

At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is ""working far better than anyone ever anticipated"", citing losses in China's stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could ""go up dramatically"" once trade deals were renegotiated. 

""The drip feed of escalating tariff threats from Trump and counter threats from China continues,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.

""With a 25 percent tariff on...(some) Chinese imports likely to commence soon, Trump is clearly ramping up the pressure on China but China is digging in,"" Oliver added.

""A tariff of this magnitude will start to have a significant economic impact on China's growth, potentially knocking up to 0.5 percent off growth, and probably also on the U.S.""

At the same time, China is stepping up measures to support its currency, which has been hit by the worsening trade skirmish.

Late on Friday, the People's Bank of China raised the reserve requirement on some foreign exchange forward positions, making it more expensive to bet against the Chinese currency and helping pull the yuan away from 14-month lows. 

The move boosted the Australian dollar, which is often played as a liquid proxy for the yuan. The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7386.

""Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilising domestic asset prices,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a note.

""Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.""

Wall Street indices gained on Friday, helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions.

According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year.

While the risk of a trade war was the main worry for investors, other factors were weighing on sentiment too.

""Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth,"" said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, has risen 3.4 percent so far this year with strong rallies since April when Trump first announced the tariffs. The index was last up 0.2 percent at 95.32.

Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. 

The British pound hovered near 11-day lows at $1.287 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an ""uncomfortably high"" risk of a ""no deal"" Brexit. 

The euro inched down to more than 5-week lows of $1.155.

Gold bounced from near 17-month lows after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, and was last at $1,212.53. 

Meanwhile, Brent crude futures rose 10 cents to $73.31, while U.S. crude oil futures added 16 cents to $68.66 a barrel.

""Anybody who did anything negative to me as a result of the lawsuit will pay,"" Mr. Butowsky said Monday. ""I'm going to sue the hell out of a lot of firms. I want to see these people choke on their nerves and go through the same crap I had to go through.""

Last August, Mr. Butowsky, managing director of Chapwood Investments, was named in two high-profile lawsuits related to a since-retracted Fox News story about murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. The two lawsuits also named Fox News and a Fox News reporter, Malia Zimmerman. One suit was brought by Mr. Rich's parents and the other by Rod Wheeler, an investigator looking into Mr. Rich's death for his parents.

The defamation lawsuits were dismissed Thursday by U.S. District Judge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York, who cited a failure to prove statements were false or a basis for the defamation claims.

Mr. Butowsky isn't yet ready to move past the publicized allegations that he conspired with Fox News and ""worked in concert under the watchful eye of the White House to concoct a story about the death of a young DNC aide.""

""The story around this case had everything to do with the lawyer who filed the lawsuit,"" said Mr. Butowsky, referring to Doug Wigdor of the New York law firm of Wigdor, who represented Mr. Wheeler. 





""Lawyers can put anything they want in a lawsuit; there's so much flexibility, it's hideous,"" Mr. Butowsky said. ""For a year I've been known as the guy who is Trump's backer, and as someone who loves Trump and made up stories to divert attention from what really happened.""

The Wigdor law firm refused to comment on the dismissal, but pointed out that it had stopped representing Mr. Wheeler on May 30. Eli J. Kay-Oliphant, an attorney at Massey & Gail who represents the Riches, did not return a call for comment.

Mr. Butowsky said he still stands by the retracted Fox News story.

""I didn't see anything wrong with [Malia Zimmerman's] article,"" he said. ""Despite the claims, Rod Wheeler was not misquoted. The story is that Wigdor made up stuff related to Malia's story.""

Mr. Butowsky said his financial planning business was negatively affected by the news reports about the lawsuit.





""We lost about a third of our business last year related to a made-up story by a greedy lawyer,"" he said. ""I lost a lot of clients on day one. Some wouldn't even pick up the phone, and the ones that did wouldn't listen to my side of the story. And the clients that stayed with me are still skeptical.""

In April, Mr. Butowsky filed a $100 million lawsuit against Charles Schwab Corp. after the custodian terminated its 12-year relationship with Chapwood, without cause, according to the lawsuit.

That lawsuit, which Mr. Butowsky said he is still pursuing, claims Schwab's ""intentional wrongdoing"" caused Chapwood's assets under management to decline by $45 million to less than $200 million.

The suit also claims that after being kicked off of the custodian platform, Chapwood lost ""over 268 customer accounts and suffered substantial loss of income.""

A Schwab spokeswoman, Mayura Hooper, wrote in an email that ""Schwab has terminated its relationship with Chapwood Capital Investment under the terms of our contractual agreement, effective January 22, 2018."" 

""The termination was a business decision following a thorough business review of Chapwood,"" Ms. Hooper said. ""We do not publicly discuss the details of our business reviews.""

In addition to his plans for a string of lawsuits, Mr. Butowsky is preparing to go after any financial advisers who took advantage of the situation by poaching his clients.

""To those financial advisers that went after my clients, I know who they are, and I'm going to go after them and my clients,"" he said. 

Mr. Butowsky said that in addition to the damage to his business and reputation, the defamation lawsuits took a toll on his personal life.

""I had death threats, and vandalism to my home and car,"" he said. ""There was even a death clock on the internet counting down the days till my 20-year-old son got back to Vanderbilt, so somebody could kill him.""

•Through the proposed Citizen Connectivity Study, the consultants will survey households and businesses to understand how they currently use technology and the importance of high-speed digital connectivity. Survey results will reveal the benefits of and barriers to technology use, particularly available internet access options. Working with City departmental leaders, the FE/Magellan Team will engage key stakeholders, from major businesses to neighborhood champions, to define current gaps and goals. A series of workshops will be conducted to gather input and learn about connectivity needs and opportunities. The insights and anecdotal evidence from these discussions will allow for deep insights into what connectivity means for Portsmouth's citizenry in today's global digital economy.

The FE/Magellan Team will supplement its extensive knowledge from designing Portsmouth's new fiber-optic network with research into other regional network infrastructure. The area has numerous large entities that own infrastructure, in part because it is a major pass-through area for the east coast and termination points for undersea cables. Network service providers are invited to share connectivity issues they have encountered and how they might help address community needs.

•Portsmouth's community broadband network will include connections to community anchor institutions such as hospitals, higher education centers, and will serve as a catalyst to narrow the digital divide and regional broadband initiatives. Construction began in July. Daniel Jones, chief information officer for the city of Portsmouth said the project is a five-year build-out that will make Portsmouth a digital port. The community broadband network is a $9 million multiphase capital project.
•""The Citizen Connectivity Study will provide precise information on what businesses and citizens actually need when it comes to high-speed internet connectivity,"" said Jones. ""Our project will connect all municipal facilities including schools and the broadband network will improve municipal operations at a substantial cost savings.""
•The study will be conducted in conjunction with a new Smart City study group being established by the City. The consultant will engage with the community through this group, as well as local associations, civic leagues, and businesses. Results from the surveys, discussions, and infrastructure inventory will be analyzed along with input from these groups to establish a strategy and action plan for the City. The connectivity study is expected to be completed over the next five months.

(NYSE: WTM) reported book value per share of $924 and adjusted book value per share of $912 as of June 30, 2018.  Book value per share and adjusted book value per share both increased 1% in the second quarter of 2018.  Book value per share decreased 1% and adjusted book value per share was near break-even in the first six months of 2018, including dividends.

HG Global/BAM

BAM insured municipal bonds with par value of $3.1 billion and $4.4 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $2.7 billion and $5.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  Gross written premiums and member surplus contributions totaled $29 million and $40 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $20 million and $48 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  Total pricing, which is gross written premiums and MSC adjusted to include the present value of future installment MSC not yet collected and to exclude the impact of gross written premium adjustments on existing policies, weighted by the par value of municipal bonds insured, was 101 and 100 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to 79 and 98 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  BAM's total claims paying resources were $827 million at June 30, 2018, compared to $708 million at December 31, 2017 and $676 million at June 30, 2017.  The increase in claims paying resources was primarily driven by the $100 million reinsurance agreement with Fidus Re completed in the second quarter of 2018.

Seán McCarthy, CEO of BAM, said, ""In the second quarter, new-issue municipal bond volume recovered, and longer-term new-money transactions represented a larger share of the total market volume. These favorable trends allowed BAM to more than double its primary and secondary market volume, quarter over quarter, while maintaining attractive risk-adjusted pricing levels.  Claims-paying resources finished the quarter at an all-time high, reflecting the close of the Fidus Re transaction, which added $100 million of reinsurance protection in the form of collateralized insurance-linked securities.  On June 25th, S&P Global Ratings affirmed BAM's AA/Stable rating, citing BAM's market acceptance, proven track record of credit discipline and growth in par insured and premiums written.""

HG Global reported pre-tax income of $8 million and $12 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax income of $7 million and $13 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  White Mountains reported pre-tax loss related to BAM of $17 million and $36 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax loss of $12 million and $24 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The changes at BAM were driven primarily by lower investment returns in 2018.

BAM is a mutual insurance company that is owned by its members.  BAM's results are consolidated into White Mountains's GAAP financial statements and attributed to non-controlling interests.

NSM

On May 11, 2018, White Mountains acquired 95% of NSM Insurance HoldCo, LLC (""NSM""), an insurance program administrator.  White Mountains paid $274 million of cash consideration for its equity interest in NSM.

Subsequently, on May 18, 2018, NSM acquired 100% of Fresh Insurance Services Group Limited (""Fresh Insurance""), an insurance broker that specializes in non-standard personal lines, motor trade, van, and travel insurance in the United Kingdom.  NSM paid GBP 37 million (approximately $50 million based on the spot rate at the date of acquisition) of upfront cash consideration for its equity interest in Fresh Insurance.

NSM reported revenues of $24 million and pre-tax income of $3 million for the period from May 11, 2018 through June 30, 2018.

Geof McKernan, CEO of NSM Insurance Group, said, ""We are excited to partner with White Mountains, whose insurance expertise and patient approach to value creation are a natural fit with NSM.  We've hit the ground running, closing the Fresh acquisition only one week after joining White Mountains.  With Fresh, we've added a strong operation with non-standard personal lines expertise that will complement Vantage Insurance Group, our UK specialist insurance agency.  More broadly, our business is performing well across most lines, in the US and the UK, producing modest top and bottom line growth during the quarter.""

MediaAlpha

MediaAlpha reported pre-tax income of $5 million and $4 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax loss of $2 million and $3 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  MediaAlpha's adjusted EBITDA was $8 million and $17 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $1 million and $3 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  MediaAlpha reported revenues of $72 million and $144 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $31 million and $63 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The increases in pre-tax income, adjusted EBITDA and revenues for both periods were primarily driven by growth in the P&C vertical and the Health, Medicare and Life vertical, which includes the impact of the acquisition of assets from Healthplans.com in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Cost of sales was $60 million and $117 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $26 million and $54 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by transaction volume growth.  General and administrative expenses were $5 million and $16 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $4 million and $7 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The increase for the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 was primarily driven by the recognition of non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $7 million in the first six months of 2018.

Other Operations

White Mountains's Other Operations segment reported pre-tax loss of $11 million and $62 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to pre-tax income of $4 million and $7 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  The changes were driven primarily by lower investment returns in 2018, partially offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses.  Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) were $13 million and $(33) million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to net realized and unrealized gains of $33 million and $68 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  Net investment income was $8 million and $24 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $12 million and $22 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  General and administrative expenses were $31 million and $53 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to $41 million and $86 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, which included higher incentive compensation costs.

Share Repurchases

During the second quarter of 2018, White Mountains repurchased and retired 575,068 of its common shares for $505 million at an average price per share of $878, or approximately 96% of White Mountains's June 30, 2018 adjusted book value per share.  For the first six months of 2018, White Mountains repurchased and retired 585,033 of its common shares for $513 million at an average share price of $877, or approximately 96% of White Mountains's June 30, 2018 adjusted book value per share.  This activity left White Mountains with $1.3 billion of undeployed capital as of June 30, 2018.

Investments

The total return on invested assets was 0.7% in the second quarter of 2018 and -0.3% in the first six months of 2018, compared to returns of 1.4% in the second quarter of 2017 and 2.9% in the first six months of 2017.

Mark Plourde, Managing Director of White Mountains Advisors, said, ""The total portfolio was up 0.7% in the quarter, a decent result.  The fixed income portfolio returned 0.3%, outperforming the BBIA Index.  Common stocks and ETFs returned 2.1%, lagging the S&P 500 Index, primarily due to underperformance in our international common stock positions.""

•Delivered record second quarter Net income of $21.2 million, or $0.91 per diluted share
•Paid $0.265 per share cash dividend 
•Company narrows Full-Year 2018 outlook 
•Record results driven by strong pre-season sales of commercial snow and ice control products and a return to average snow levels
•Chassis supply issues continue to impact sales of Municipal products

MILWAUKEE, Aug. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Douglas Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE: PLOW), North America’s premier manufacturer and upfitter of work truck attachments and equipment, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018.

James L. Janik, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “Our record results this quarter reflect a strong start to the pre-season for our commercial snow and ice control products, which met our internal expectations. We continue to manage through the industry wide chassis availability issues, which impacted sales of our municipal products. As we proceed into the second half of the year, we are pleased with the performance of the overall business but are aware that the chassis supply issues will continue to hinder our performance in the coming quarters. We are focused on optimizing the factors that are within our control and continuing to drive improvements across both segments through ongoing DDMS initiatives.”

Consolidated Second Quarter 2018 Results

Net sales were a quarterly-record $163.4 million, an increase of 17% when compared to second quarter 2017 net sales of $139.4 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the robust performance of the Work Truck Attachments segment during the quarter, combined with solid performance of the Work Truck Solutions segment.

Gross profit was a quarterly-record $55.8 million, or 34.2% of net sales, compared to $45.0 million, or 32.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017. The increase is similarly attributable to the strong performance by the Work Truck Attachments segment during the quarter.  Additionally, gross profit as a percentage of sales increased for the second quarter of 2018 due to higher volumes at both Work Truck Attachments and Work Truck Solutions.

The Company’s effective tax rate was 24.6% and 34.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was lower than the corresponding period in 2017 due to the lower corporate tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that went into effect December 22, 2017.

Net income for the second quarter of 2018 was a second quarter-record $21.2 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017.

Adjusted net income was a quarterly-record $23.5 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $14.9 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2017.

The Company reported quarterly-record Adjusted EBITDA of $40.1 million, a significant increase when compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $31.3 million in the second quarter of 2017.

Work Truck Attachments Second Quarter 2018 Results

Work Truck Attachments segment recorded revenue of $127.3 million, resulting in income from operations of $38.8 million, compared to $105.5 million in revenue and $27.1 million in income from operations in the second quarter of 2017. Both data points met initial internal expectations, given the snowfall for the period. Snowfall in the markets served by the Company during the snow season ended March 31, 2018 was near historical averages, while the snow season ending March 31, 2017 saw below average levels.

The Company’s commercial snow and ice management products include a pre-season ordering period that extends across the second and third quarters. For the past two years, pre-season sales were more heavily weighted towards the second quarter versus the third quarter in an approximate 55%-45% split, which is in line with historical trends and averages. However, for 2018, the Company anticipates an approximate 60%-40% split of preseason ordering between the second and third quarters.

Janik explained, “The pre-season performance for our commercial snow and ice management products has been right on schedule, benefitting from the average snowfall levels across the country this past winter, plus a positive response to the new products we launched earlier this year. External factors such as the economy and truck sales also continue to be in our favor and we anticipate a larger proportion of pre-season sales occurring in the second quarter rather than the third quarter this year. While we do expect chassis supply issues for our municipal products in the second half of the year, the good news is that demand and backlog for our municipal products and services has never been greater, and our teams are doing all they can to deliver for their customers.”

Work Truck Solutions Second Quarter 2018 Results

Work Truck Solutions segment produced revenue of $37.1 million and $0.5 million in income from operations, compared to $34.9 million in revenue and $2.5 million in income from operations in the second quarter of 2017.  The increase in revenue relates primarily to generally improved demand dynamics compared to the same period last year, and the ongoing ramp up in additional facilities that opened in 2017. The profitability of the Work Truck Solutions segment was impacted by the continuing ramp of new facilities, higher variable compensation and benefit expense, and unusual legal expenses related to defending our intellectual property.

“We produced a solid quarter in Solutions and saw strong demand patterns as we continue to make the necessary investments in the business to produce sustainable long-term growth,” noted Janik.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity

During the first six months of 2018, the Company recorded net cash provided by operating activities of $11.0 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $13.3 million in the same period last year.

Inventory was $84.6 million compared to $85.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Accounts receivable were $95.0 million compared to $80.1 million at the end of the second quarter 2017. The decrease in inventory and increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from the corresponding increase in sales.

Dividend 

As previously reported, on June 7, 2018 the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.265 per share of the Company's common stock. The dividend was paid on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 19, 2018.

Outlook

Based on recent results, the overall economic climate, dealer sentiment, and industry trends, the Company is narrowing its 2018 financial outlook as follows:
•Net sales are now expected to be between $490 million and $535 million.
•Adjusted EBITDA is now predicted to range from $90 million to $110 million.
•Adjusted Earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $1.75 per share to $2.05 per share.

It is important to note that the Company’s outlook assumes that the economy will remain stable and that the Company’s core markets will experience average snowfall levels in the fourth quarter.

Mr. Janik added, “As usual, we have narrowed our outlook ranges now that we have more visibility and are pleased with our projections for the year. The shift in the revenue range also reflects pricing changes we are implementing in light of impending inflation of components and raw materials. While we are certainly proud of the Company’s accomplishments this quarter, it is important to remember that we do expect the third quarter to be less robust by comparison, as some pre-season sales we would typically expect to occur in the third quarter were pulled ahead into the second quarter, plus the negative impact of the chassis supply issues impacting the industry. As we’ve regularly said, we will execute our strategy to continue to deliver shareholder value over the long-term.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).  The non-GAAP measure used in this press release is Adjusted EBITDA.

These non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for stock-based compensation, litigation proceeds, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and certain charges related to certain unrelated legal fees and consulting fees.  The Company uses, and believes its investors benefit from the presentation of, Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because Adjusted EBITDA provides the Company and its investors with additional tools to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of its consolidated financial statements in evaluating the Company’s operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. The Company’s management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and financial projections, and to evaluate the Company’s ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with its senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.

Consistent with Regulation G under the U.S. federal securities laws, the non-GAAP measure in this press release has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure, and this reconciliation is located under the heading ""Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation"" following the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this press release.

With respect to the Company’s 2018 guidance, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP because it does not provide specific guidance for the various extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual charges and other certain items. These items have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. As a result, reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance measures to GAAP is not available without unreasonable effort and the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

Earned Net Income per Diluted Share of $0.10

Delivered Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share of $0.19

ATLANTA, Aug. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mueller Water Products, Inc. (NYSE:MWA) announced today that for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended June 30, 2018 net sales were $250.2 million and net income was $15.3 million.

In the 2018 third quarter, the Company:
•Increased net sales 7.8 percent, or $18.0 million, to $250.2 million as compared with $232.2 million in the prior year quarter.
•Generated operating income of $30.6 million and adjusted operating income of $47.3 million as compared with $43.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively, in the prior year quarter.
•Reported income from continuing operations of $15.3 million as compared with $24.1 million in the prior year quarter.  Improved adjusted net income to $30.0 million as compared with $25.4 million in the prior year quarter.
•Recorded a $14.1 million warranty charge at Technologies, a $6.2 million charge related to debt refinancing, a $2.4 million settlement gain on termination of interest rate swap contracts and other charges of $2.6 million.
•Reported net income per diluted share of $0.10 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.19 as compared with net income per diluted share of $0.15 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.16 in the prior year quarter.
•Generated $43.2 million of free cash flow through the first nine months as compared with $3.8 million in the prior year period.
•Refinanced outstanding debt with $450 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2026 and decreased outstanding debt by $33.9 million.

“With net sales growth of 7.8 percent in the quarter, we continue to be very encouraged by the healthy demand in both municipal and residential end markets.  Infrastructure and Technologies each generated solid volume growth in the quarter.  In addition, we are benefiting from the price increases we implemented in the second quarter, which more than covered inflation.  We also increased our adjusted operating income and adjusted net income per share.  However, conversion margin lagged in the quarter primarily due to higher costs associated with inflation, some unexpected equipment downtime and repairs, and timing of certain SG&A expenses,” said Scott Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mueller Water Products.

“We continue to make solid progress on our key initiatives to execute our go-to-market strategies as a customer-focused organization, drive operational excellence and accelerate new product development.  Our new product development initiatives are gaining momentum.  At the American Water Works Association Annual Conference, we introduced a smart fire hydrant that monitors pressure and detects leaks, and at Singapore International Water Week, we showcased the deployment of our EchoShore® TX leak detection monitoring system being used by PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency.

“We anticipate continued growth in our end markets in 2018.  For full year 2018, we expect our consolidated net sales increase to be at the high end of the 7 to 9 percent range we provided last quarter, with adjusted operating income growing between 9 and 11 percent.

“I am excited about where we are with our strategic initiatives and the contribution they should provide to our performance going forward.  Our growth strategies are supported by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow with a capital allocation strategy focused on enhancing our position as a leading water infrastructure company.”

Consolidated Results

Net sales for the 2018 third quarter increased $18.0 million, or 7.8 percent, to $250.2 million as compared with $232.2 million in the 2017 third quarter with growth in both segments.

Adjusted operating income increased to $47.3 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $45.0 million in the 2017 third quarter.

Segment Results

Infrastructure

Net sales for the 2018 third quarter increased $16.5 million, or 7.9 percent, to $224.1 million as compared with $207.6 million in the 2017 third quarter, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and higher pricing.

Operating income was $57.0 million in the quarter.  Adjusted operating income for the 2018 third quarter increased 5.2 percent to $57.0 million as compared with $54.2 million in the 2017 third quarter.  Adjusted operating income increased primarily due to higher pricing and higher shipment volumes, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with inflation, unexpected equipment downtime and repairs, and timing of certain SG&A expenses.

Technologies

Net sales for the 2018 third quarter increased $1.5 million, or 6.1 percent, to $26.1 million, as compared with $24.6 million in the 2017 third quarter, due to higher volumes.

During the quarter, we completed a new study of our historical warranty experience.  As a result of this new information, we recorded a warranty charge of $14.1 million during the quarter.

Operating loss was $16.1 million in the 2018 third quarter, which includes the $14.1 million warranty charge mentioned above, and was $1.6 million in the prior year quarter.  Adjusted operating loss was $2.0 million in the 2018 third quarter and was $1.6 million in the 2017 third quarter.  Adjusted operating loss increased primarily due to increased costs associated with unexpected equipment downtime and repairs and inflation, partially offset by higher volumes.

Interest Expense, Net and Related Items

Interest expense, net for the 2018 third quarter was $5.3 million as compared with $5.1 million in the 2017 third quarter.  During the third quarter, we issued $450 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due in 2026.  We repaid our outstanding term loan with proceeds from the offering and cash on hand.  We wrote-off the deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount associated with the term loan, resulting in a one-time non-cash charge of $6.2 million.  In addition, we terminated our interest swap contracts and recorded a one-time $2.4 million cash gain.

Income Taxes

For the 2018 third quarter, the Company reported income tax expense of $6.0 million, or 28.2 percent of income before income taxes.  This rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, manufacturing deductions and discrete items.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company’s results as determined under GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP information that management believes is useful to investors.  These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and securities analysts, investors and other interested parties should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP.  These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The Company presents adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as performance measures because management uses these measures in evaluating the Company’s underlying performance on a consistent basis across periods and in making decisions about operational strategies.  Management also believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company’s recurring performance.

The Company presents net debt and net debt leverage as performance measures because management uses them in evaluating its capital management, and the investment community commonly uses them as measures of indebtedness.  The Company presents free cash flow because management believes it is commonly used by the investment community to measure the Company’s ability to create liquidity.

The calculations of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to GAAP results are included as an attachment to this press release and have been posted online at www.muellerwaterproducts.com.

Investors in bond ETFs turned more cautious in August as a selloff roiled emerging markets and the Federal Reserve said it would continue raising interest rates in the U.S.

Flows into exchange-traded funds that buy corporate debt moderated, with inflows into ETFs that own investment-grade securities slumping to $4.6 billion, the lowest since February. Appetite for junk bonds also faded. Instead, government bonds—widely regarded as the safest asset class—were back in style, receiving $2.5 billion after posting their most disappointing month of the year in July.

ETFs holding bonds that come due in one-to-three years absorbed a similar amount, which was the most since May and almost double the flow into intermediate- and long-term bonds combined. However, interest in ultra short-term bonds slipped as funds owning debt with less than a year to maturity gained just $1.2 billion, the least since January.

Bank loan-focused funds were the only ETFs to lose assets in August, surrendering about $340 million.


Bloomberg’s Fixed-Income ETF tracker monitors fund flows to provide a monthly gauge of investor sentiment.
"Dan Ivascyn Goes ‘Defensive’ With $114 Billion Pimco Income Fund,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/dan-ivascyn-goes-defensive-with-114-billion-pimco-income-fund,https://www.bloomberg.com/,No,Market,"Daniel Ivascyn says it’s time to take a more “cautious and defensive” strategy with the $113.7 billion Pimco Income Fund.



The chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. said he’s taking the tack as central banks move away from accommodating policies that have buttressed markets since the 2008 financial crisis.



“For both equity and fixed income investors, we think this means lower returns and, unfortunately, higher volatility,” Ivascyn and Alfred Murata, co-managers of the largest actively managed bond fund, said in a post Tuesday on the firm’s website. “This combination creates a much more challenging investment environment.”





























The upshot: the fund will increase liquidity and diversification, he said. The plan includes being cautious about U.S. credit while looking for smaller opportunities in the global fixed-income universe.






Fixed-income managers have struggled to generate positive returns this year as interest rates rise, which drives down bond prices.

Pimco Income has lost 0.1 percent this year through Aug. 6. It has returned an average of 5.9 percent annually for the last five years, outperforming 99 percent of Bloomberg peers.

The fund will continue to invest in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, which have increased in supply over the last year, fueled by the introduction of about $300 billion backed by home loans that had previously been in default but are now being paid, according to Murata.

They are the fastest growing type of loan - and they could help save you money and improve your credit score.

Here's what you need to know about personal loans and how they can benefit you.

What Is A Personal Loan?

A personal loan is an unsecured loan typically from $1,000 - $100,000 typically with a fixed interest rate that can be used to consolidate debt or make a large purchase. The term ""unsecured"" means you don't have to put up any collateral.



Depending on your credit profile, you may be able to qualify for a low-interest rate personal loan and save money compared to a credit card. Interest rates on personal loans are often much lower than the interest rates on credit cards, which typically range from 10-20% (or higher).

The interest rate on your personal loan will depend on several factors, which may include your credit score, credit history, monthly cash flow and debt-to-income ratio.

The stronger your credit profile and history of financial responsibility, the lower the interest rate you can expect.


When Should You Use A Personal Loan?

Personal loans are best for purchases that you plan to repay in less than five years.

Unlike student loans or mortgages that are spent on specific purchases such as education or a home, respectively, personal loans can be spent at your discretion.

Therefore, you have more flexibility and personal choice when using a personal loan.

1. Debt Consolidation and Credit Card Debt Consolidation
 


Debt consolidation is one of the most popular - and smartest - reasons to obtain a personal loan.

You can use a personal loan for debt consolidation in two primary ways:
1.Pay off existing high-interest debt (such as credit card debt) with a lower-interest personal loan
2.Combine different types of existing debt into a single personal loan to make debt repayment more organized and manageable

You can use a personal loan to consolidate high-interest credit card debt, and obtain a lower interest rate to help pay off your debt faster.

Of course, that assumes you will take advantage of the lower interest rate and lower monthly payments to accelerate your credit card pay off.

Therefore:
•DO use a personal loan to repay credit card debt and become debt-free.
•DO NOT use a personal loan as a tool to postpone debt repayment.

How A Personal Loan Can Cut Your Credit Card Interest By 50%

Here's how to cut your credit card interest rate by up to 50%:

1. Compare the interest rate on your credit card with the interest rate on the personal loan to determine which interest rate is lower.

2. If you have good or excellent credit, you should be able to obtain an interest rate lower than your current credit card interest rate.

3. If you qualify for a lower interest rate, make sure you can repay the personal loan over the loan period (such as five years, for example). Having a shorter-term loan repayment period can not only save you interest costs, but also instill discipline to retire your debt more quickly.

You can use this credit card consolidation calculator to see how much money you can save with a credit card consolidation loan.

Are There Alternatives To A Personal Loan?

There are several alternatives to a personal loan. For example, if you have good or excellent credit and plan to pay-off your existing credit card debt in 12-15 months, you could get a 0% APR credit card and make a balance transfer.

If you own your home, a home equity loan is usually a lower cost option. However, unlike a personal loan, a home equity loan is a secured loan so that means your home serves as collateral and can be claimed by the lender if you do not repay the debt.

How A Personal Loan Can Improve Your Credit Score

Can borrowing debt actually improve your credit score?

Surprisingly, yes. Here's how.

Lenders evaluate your credit card utilization, or the relationship between your credit limit and spending in a given month. If you have credit card debt and your credit utilization is too high, lenders may consider you higher risk.

Here are some ways to manage your credit card utilization:
•set up automatic balance alerts
•ask your lender to raise your credit limit (this may involve a hard credit pull so check with your lender first)
•rather than pay your balance with a single payment at the end of the month, make multiple payments throughout the month

You can also use a personal loan to help with credit utilization. For example, you may improve your credit score if you replace credit card debt with a personal loan.

Why? A personal loan is an installment loan, which means a personal loan carries a fixed repayment term. Credit cards, however, are revolving loans and have no fixed repayment term. Therefore, when you swap credit card debt for a personal loan, you can lower your credit utilization and also diversify your debt types.

2. Medical Expenses

If you have a medical emergency or unexpected medical expense and are unable to pay the full cost in cash upfront, a personal loan can be a better solution than a credit card.

Often, you can qualify for a higher loan amount with a personal loan than a credit card, which may be necessary for your health expenses.

3. Emergency Home Repair Or Home Improvement

If you need to complete an emergency home repair or a small home improvement project, and cannot take a home equity loan, access a line of credit or refinance your mortgage, then a personal loan may be an attractive option.

A personal loan can make good financial sense for a home renovation project if the renovation improves the financial value of your home (and the cost to borrow the personal loan is less than the expected appreciation of your home as a result of the renovation project).

4. Other Uses For A Personal Loan

A personal loan can used to help pay for other key life events, including an engagement ring, wedding, moving, honeymoon and many other uses.

Like any debt obligation, ask yourself whether your reason to obtain a personal loan is a ""want"" or a ""need.""

Final Thoughts: Personal Loans

Given the increase in online lending, the good news is that you can apply and receive cash from a personal loan within days.

A personal loan, however, should not be an excuse to acquire more debt. Rather, a personal loan can be a helpful tool for a smart borrower who has an action plan to get debt-free and march down the path toward financial freedom.

""Sound Off for Aug. 7: Why not add grandfather clause to AFRH tenants’ rent
",https://www.sunherald.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article216221290.html,https://www.sunherald.com/,No,Market,"A different outcome? 

I think the Long Beach tax increase vote would have had a much different outcome had it been conducted similar to all other legal elections in the state rather than at the school itself. The elderly should not be forced to stand in line for hours to cast their vote, especially when you consider that they are living on a fixed income and may not be able to afford a tax increase. 

No shame 

Great article by reporter Robin Fitzgerald. Making people aware that this is a disease should facilitate more addicts and families asking for help without shame.

 




SIGN UP  
A good thing? 



I’ll give you that alcohol’s negative effects on society are harmful. So legalizing another intoxicant would be a good thing?

A better solution 

This is in reference to the rent increases at the Armed Forces Retirement Home. A more compassionate solution would be to grandfather in all existing tenants and set new rate for new tenants. We have Washington, D.C., paying lip service to those who got us here and then doing something like this.

Can’t buy class 

What a shame it is to have a so-called president hurling insults like a second grader. He has no filter. Love him or hate him there is one thing that we can all agree on. All the money in the world and all the power can’t buy you “class.” 



Ready to help 

I think all school rooms should be equipped with a portable, quick-install, door barricade. These devices are inexpensive and extremely effective. If money is an issue I believe citizens of this county would step forward to pay for the barricades. Even though I do not have children in school and am on a fixed income, I will gladly pay for 10 portable door barricades.

Wake up everyone 

It is disgraceful that Congress can spends billions on foreign aid and illegals while our veterans have to live in fear of not being able to afford living in a military retirement home. We should storm the halls of Congress, but we are too busy looking down at our phones to care. USA, wake up.

A casino on I-10? 



We in Long Beach voted against a casino and there has been no election since. My understanding was all the casinos put money into all the schools along the Coast, not just where they were located. I also remember when the casinos said they would not compete with our restaurants, but they surely are. If a casino does at some point locate in Long Beach, I suggest it locate on Interstate 10.

Should I have a holding in an aggregate bond ETF at this stage, since short-term interest rates seem destined to go higher and this will affect my short-term bond portfolio?

– Dali

A: The Bank of Canada has now raised its key interest rate (called the target for the overnight rate) four times since July 2017, taking it from 0.5% to 1.5%. Many forecasters expect another hike in October. As you can attest, Dali, these rate hikes have hurt fixed-income investors, since bond prices and interest rates move like a seesaw: when one goes up, the other goes down.


READ: How rising interest rates actually affect you

But the Bank of Canada’s target is not the only interest rate that affects the fixed income market. The central bank’s rate directly affects lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, bonds with short maturities—like the ones that make up 40% of your portfolio, Dali. But in the 12 months that followed the first central bank rate increase in July 2017, the yield on 10-year Government of Canada bonds ticked up only slightly, and the yield on long-term bonds (the Bank of Canada’s benchmark has a 30-year term) actually declined. So if you held an “aggregate” bond ETF—one that holds a mix of short, intermediate and long-term bonds—you escaped most of the damage.

Click here to see more personal finance questions answered.

Problem is, we can’t predict how interest rates will move in the future. Recently short-term yields have risen the fastest, but that may not continue. The yields on five-, 10- and 20-year bonds might soon catch up—or they might not. Trying to reposition your portfolio to profit from these moves is futile, and often counterproductive.



Dali, if you are looking for a little more stability in your income-oriented portfolio you might instead consider holding less in short-term bonds and more in GICs. The latter offer several advantages:
•Unlike bond ETFs, which move up or down with every change in interest rates, GICs don’t fluctuate in price, and many investors find this comforting.
•GICs offer significantly higher yields than government bonds of the same maturity: for example, a five-year Government of Canada bond yields about 2.2% today, compared with as much as 3.5% for a five-year GIC if you shop around.
•GICs are insured against default by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) for up to $100,000 per issuer.
•Building a GIC ladder (keeping equal amounts in GICs with terms of one, two, three, four and five years) allows you to spread out your risk so you won’t be strongly affected by modest moves in interest rates, either up or down.

The biggest downside of GICs is that you cannot sell them before maturity. But, Dali, as long as you make sure you have enough liquidity elsewhere in your portfolio, you can likely hold more in GICs than you are now. That should help ease your concerns about the possibility of rising interest rates.

The U.S. administration is already looking into finalizing plans that would inflict tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, after a public comment period expired recently.

Investors will also watch Washington's relationship with other major economies. Canada and the U.S. have yet to secure a deal that would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

"Five Things to Know: Ally Challenge,https://www.pgatour.com/champions/news/2018/09/9/five-things-to-know-for-the-ally-challenge.html,https://www.pgatour.com/,No,Liquidity,"The Ally Challenge is one of two new events upon us during this stretch of three tournaments in three weeks. It's new, but in a lot of ways, it's very familiar to both golf fans and many of the players that will compete. For example, Tom Pernice, Jr. will be making his 19th start at Warwick Hills. The PGA TOUR hosted the Buick Open at Warwick Hills from 1956 through the 2009 season. It might be more appropriate to say that the Ally Challenge is bringing professional golf back to Warwick Hills and Grand Blanc, Michigan. The field is absolutely packed to the rafters with past winners and the top players on the Charles Schwab Cup standings. Nine of the top ten on the Charles Schwab Cup standings will tee it up. The only player in the top 10 not in the field is No. 1 Miguel Angel Jimenez. 

Here are five things you should certainly know heading into the week.

1. Vijay Singh has to be a favorite

Vijay singh owned Warwick Hills. He won the Buick Open back-to-back years in 2004 and 2005. He also won in 1997. He made 11 starts at the Buick Open and had three wins and eight top 20 finishes. His scoring average over 42 rounds at Warwick Hills is 68.88. Further, he won a total of $2,258,437 from his performances over the years in Grand Blanc. So, safe to say that Warwick Hills helped his bank account. Singh's schedule has slowly increased since his first start on PGA TOUR Champions in 2013. He has already played in more events this year (13) than he did all of last season (12). He has a pair of wins and five top 10 finishes so far. 

2. Tiger Woods really loved Warwick Hills

Tiger Woods is the last man to hoist a trophy in a PGA TOUR sanctioned event at Warwick Hills. He won in 2009. Woods also won in Grand Blanc in 2006 and 2002. He made nine appearances in the Buick Open and his finishes are staggering: three wins, two second place finishes, a third and a fourth. His worst finish, yes worst, is a tie for 11th. He also had a milestone win. His 50th PGA TOUR win came at Warwick Hills in 2006 and the tournament had a cake made for him that was presented during the award ceremony. Woods earned almost $3.5 million in his career at Warwick Hills. 












3. History galore this week in Grand Blanc

Warwick Hills has so much history. The PGA TOUR first came to Grand Blanc in 1958. Billy Casper won the first year. The initial run was 12 straight years and then the event returned in 1977 and continued for 33 consecutive years. The list of winners at Warwick Hills is a whos who in golf circles: Peter Jacobsen (1980), Lanny Wadkins (1982), Brad Faxon (1991), Larry Mize (1993), Fred Couples (1994), Justin Leonard (1996) and Jim Furyk (2003). The first televised hole-in-one also took place at Warwick Hills during the PGA TOUR event when Jerry Barber made an ace in 1965. Unrelated to history, it's worth noting that the sponsor exemption this week is Michigan native Tom Gillis, who has made two starts on PGA TOUR Champions this year and has finished tied for third both times. Gillis is a Pontiac native and Lake Orion High School graduate. He won once on the Web.com Tour. 

4. Countdown to the Charles Schwab Cup Playoffs

There are just four events remaining before the top 72 begin the three-event Charles Schwab Cup Playoffs at the Dominion Energy Charity Classic from October 19-21. Over the next four events, players will jockey for position to qualify for the playoffs. It's interesting to note that No. 73 on the current Charles Schwab Cup standings is Rod Spittle, who announced his retirement after the Shaw Charity Classic. No. 74 is Christopher Williams, who has made just three starts this year. The high profile names on the bubble right now are Davis Love III at No. 68, Mark O'Meara at No. 66 and Larry Mize at No. 63. John Daly is also not a shoe-in by any means as he is teetering at No. 61. 

5. Events surrounding the tournament

Like all PGA TOUR Champions events, there will be a lot happening outside the ropes including a 5K race on Saturday morning, but the main draw is a Big & Rich concert on Friday night. Tournaments have spoiled the players and staff lately with some big name country acts. Blake Shelton recently performed at the DICK'S Sporting Goods Open.

"World shares face longest losing streak since January 2016,http://www.euronews.com/2018/09/10/asian-shares-on-slippery-slope-as-trade-tensions-take-toll,http://www.euronews.com,Yes,Market,"LONDON (Reuters) - World shares were flirting with their longest run of declines since early 2016 on Monday, hit by rising anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war and another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this month.

Europe <.STOXX> defended its ground early on [.EU], but it was proving a struggle after a fresh sell-off by Chinese shares [.SS] pulled Asian <.MIAPJ0000PUS> and emerging-market equities <.MSCIEF> to 14-month lows.

Traders were bracing for a potential escalation in the Sino-U.S. tariff row after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in the dispute on Friday.

He said he was ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods in addition to the $200 billion already facing threatened tariffs.

On top of that, strong U.S. jobs numbers on Friday had bolstered bets on a higher dollar on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep raising U.S. interest rates. 

""It's more of the same, markets continue to be under pressure from a whole host of headwinds,"" said fund manager GAM's Investment Director of emerging market equities, Tim Love.

He pointed to the latest fall in China's currency, the yuan, which is now down almost 9 percent versus the dollar since April. ""You are back to the highly politically charged question - is this currency manipulation or not?""

Europe's resistance to the gloom was led by Milan, which jumped 1.5 percent <.FTMIB> as soothing comments on Italy's upcoming budget by Economy Minister Giovanni Tria pushed down the country's borrowing costs in the bond markets [GVD/EUR].

Stockholm <.OMXS30> also strengthened along with the Swedish crown <SEK=> after the nationalist Sweden Democrats gained less ground than expected in weekend elections.

The crown rose about 0.6 percent against the euro <EURSEK=> to 10.43 crowns. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.1566 after falling more than half a percent on Friday following the U.S. jobs data. [/FRX] 


FRAGILE CHINA 

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.9 percent to the lowest since July 2017, extending losses from last week when it dropped 3.5 percent for its worst weekly showing since mid-March.

Beijing had warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new trade measures. But it is running out of room to match them dollar-for-dollar, raising concern it would resort to other measures, such as weakening the yuan or taking action against U.S. companies in China.

Chinese shares were battered with the blue-chip index <.CSI300> off 1.4 percent. Shanghai's SSE Composite <.SSEC> fell 1.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index <.HSI> shed 1.3 percent.

Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended 0.3 percent higher after revised second-quarter data showed the world's third-biggest economy grew at its fastest pace since 2016.

Trump, who is challenging China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union on trade issues, has also expressed displeasure about the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 

The latest 14-month low for emerging-market shares came amid turbulence in Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and South Africa, where currencies have been routed recently [EMRG/FRX].

Some Asian economies are vulnerable, too, Nomura analysts said, with many countries burdened by high private debt. They also noted a ""concentration risk"" from some of the world's largest funds' heavy investments in emerging-market assets.

The Indian rupee hit a record low of 72.50 per dollar <INR=D2> and Indonesia's rupiah - Asia's second-worst performer <IDR=ID> this year - weakened 0.4 percent, near an all-time low.

""Given the latest comments from Trump, investors are likely to see the potential for further depreciation in EM currencies with the trade war cranking up yet another notch,"" said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia.

The Australian dollar <AUD=D3>, a proxy for Chinese growth because of the large amount of metals it sells there, hovered near its lowest in 2 1/2 years and was last at $0.7115. 

Copper tumbled over 1.2 percent to cement the 20 percent drop it has seen already this year. Spot gold was lower at $1,193.01 <XAU=>. 

Oil prices bucked the trend, after three straight days of losses. U.S. crude futures <CLc1> were up 44 cents at $68.20 per barrel and Brent crude futures <LCOc1> added 52 cents to $77.35 a barrel. [O/R]

"Is Charles Schwab taking advantage of sweep account customers? ,https://nypost.com/2018/09/09/is-charles-schwab-taking-advantage-of-sweep-account-customers/,https://nypost.com/,Yes,Sales Practice,"Dear John: Charles Schwab is trying to pocket the spread between the higher rates for Treasury bills and the lower rate offered by Bank Sweep products.

A “valued customer” gets 15 basis points in a sweep product instead of the 1.23 percent offered by the US Treasury money fund.

Yes, I receive FDIC insurance. However, this guarantee is secured by the good faith and security of the US government. I think T-bills offer a similar guarantee.

Shame on Schwab! You pocket basis points against billions of dollars of customer accounts. Anonymous.

Dear Anonymous: The first thing I’m curious about is, why didn’t you give your name? I only use initials in this column, so I guess you are afraid that Schwab will know which of their “valued customers” has a gripe.

So I figure you didn’t complain to Schwab yourself, and you let me do your dirty work.

OK, I’m up for it.

Here’s what Schwab had to say:

Hi John,

“Thanks for contacting us and for the opportunity to respond to your reader’s note regarding cash solutions at Schwab. We believe cash plays an important role in any sound portfolio and that clients should have access to a wide range of cash options,” wrote a spokesman.

Then he says you have your cash in the wrong product.

“Clients should rarely leave money they intend to retain in cash for long periods of time in any sweep vehicle — whether it is a sweep money market fund or a bank sweep feature. Long-term cash should typically be invested in a purchased money-market fund for liquidity or in FDIC-insured certificates of deposit,” the spokesman continued.

“By comparison, purchased money-market funds will generally pay higher interest yields than any sweep vehicle. Ultimately, the choice of where to put uninvested cash is up to each client.”

So there you are. And I guess Schwab really is pocketing the point spread between what you are invested in and what government bills are paying. Luckily for them, people often make this kind of mistake and are afraid to ask.

Dear John: Please help me. For over 25 years I paid timely premiums to Travelers Insurance for a homeowner’s policy, believing that I was protected.

Last September my house was vandalized by tenants to the point where the county declared my home “uninhabitable.” The contractor’s estimate for repairs, obtained at Travelers’ request, is $69,000.

My claim was denied. Travelers is avoiding honoring their commitment to me because I didn’t have a “renters” policy.

How could I know that I had the wrong policy?

I trusted my insurance professional. The original policy was written when I used my beloved home for my own use. Eventually I began renting it out. This has been a nightmare. BG

Dear BG Your story is far different from the one I’m hearing from Travelers.

The company says you were warned about the policy being the wrong one and that you didn’t change it.

It’s truly a “they said, you said.”

So I’m afraid your only recourse is to get a lawyer.

But this is a good lesson for others — not necessarily about insurance. If you rent out your house, whether for a year, a month or overnight, you could end up losing a lot of things that are valuable to you.

So, don’t screw with the insurance company that covers your house.

Good luck on this one.

In late 2015, a new fashion trend hit: designer t-shirts emblazoned with the phrase “The Future Is Female.” It was on point and women of all ages, especially those in their 20s and 30s embraced them.

It’s no surprise that Millennial women connected with these four words. For the first time in decades, feminism is on the upswing. From career progression to child rearing, Millennial women are taking on the world. They are making themselves the new future.

But the phrase “The Future Is Female” is not new. It was first coined over forty years ago in 1975. The juxtaposition of this Seventies slogan on Millennial female life in the early twentieth century is quite the contrast. After all, when compared to where women were financially in the mid-70s, today’s twenty and thirty-something women are living in a different world. A world where they are likely to become the most financially independent women in history.



“Millennial women have more freedom with their finances than past generations ever did,” says Misty Lynch, a John Hancock financial advisor consulting for Twine’s Savings and Investing app. “A married woman couldn’t even get her own credit card before 1975 without permission, and single women didn’t have it much easier when it came to financial independence.”

Clearly a lot has changed.

A Greater Opportunity For Independence


A look at recent data regarding Millennial women finds that they are enjoying opportunities unavailable to women before them. Pew Research has found that these women are more likely than men to have finished at least a bachelor’s degree__ by 7 percentage points. Further, 71% of Millennial women are in the workplace and they are marrying later versus previous generations as they focus on growing their careers.

All of this puts them in a different financial situation than previous generations. While the wind may be at their back, it is important that Millennial women have a clear understanding of what they need to do to maximize their financial lives, including taking their weaknesses head on.

Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, CFP, president of the Charles Schwab Foundation and SVP of Charles Schwab & Co, Inc., addresses the potential pitfalls. “Longevity plus wage and opportunity discrimination means these women need to work harder, save more and be in charge of their finances because financial independence isn’t just a matter of strength; it’s a matter of necessity” says Schwab-Pomerantz.

Financial independence is not a sudden result but rather a lifelong journey where certain decisions and behaviors propel the individual ahead. Understanding where Millennial women need to develop more skills will help them on this road.

Developing Goals And Being Fearless About Investing

John Hancock’s Twine Savings and Investing app recently studied the financial behavior of young women ages 19-36. Forty-five percent of women surveyed said that when they set a financial goal they are motivated to achieve it. Goal orientation is key in amassing wealth as financial independence is a slow progressive journey.

On the whole, Millennial women display high confidence in areas of budgeting and bill paying but at times demonstrate a lack of confidence versus their male peers in terms of investing. The most appropriate next step for these women is to use their money strengths to gain confidence in investing and putting their money to work for them.

Alison Norris, CFP and Advice Strategist at SoFi, agrees. “Instead of shying away from the topic with others, [Millennial women should] be confident discussing it at the dinner table with peers, asking their parents how they are paying for retirement, and initiating a salary conversation with their manager. When they open it up and start talking in a human way about money, the shackles fall off.”

This is even more imperative as Millennial women enter their prime child rearing years. Twine found that currently only one third of women in this group are investing outside of a 401(k).__ Without having clear financial goals, the disparity over a lifetime versus their male peers can cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Schwab-Pomerantz advises, “Always try to live below your means. Living below your means and saving the difference is key to achieving long-term goals. If helpful, view your money in terms of trade-offs.  If I buy X, what am I giving up? Does spending money in this way support my long-term goals?”

And this means Millennial women are going to have to move beyond one issue that came out of the Twine study: that you need at least a $1,000 to invest. With the advent of easy access to the markets at a low cost, these hurdles disappear.

Lynch concurs with this thinking. “This assumption creates a false sense of intimidation for first-time investors.  Even $10 or $20 can get you going.”

As a result, by living below their means, even if just a few dollars, Millennial women need to capture these funds and put them to work. The advent of investing and savings apps makes this even easier.

Financial Independence Is A Journey

As Chantel Bonneau, financial advisor with Northwestern Mutual and a Millennial herself, noted, “Finances are similar to fitness. Getting into your ideal shape doesn’t happen overnight. It is a process that requires, time, patience, and commitment. It’s also about moderation.”

Millennial women are poised to be the most financially independent generation in history. At the same time, “The Future Is Female” T-shirts continue to sell. While it might be a fun fashion trend, in terms of financial independence, Millennial women need to embrace the opportunities they have today to grow their wealth.

"Bond support depends on changes for seniors,https://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/bond-support-depends-on-changes-for-seniors-20180909,https://www.thegazette.com/,No,Market,"The front page article in the Aug. 14 paper on the upcoming Linn-Mar Community School District bond vote (“Linn-Mar counting on voters to back $55 million bond”) had a secondary headline — “lower bond, lower tax levy on second attempt to build schools” — that we found misleading. 
   
The district’s share of our current property tax is 47 percent. The new, lower bond issue will push Linn-Mar’s share to nearly 50 percent. 
   
Set to hit fixed income property owners again, Linn-Mar needs to approach state legislators with a second angle to their bond issue. There are states that freeze property taxes for owners, once they reach age 65. Additionally, there are states that exempt Social Security and pension income from state income tax. More bond issues would pass if these senior tax issues were addressed. 
   
Cities could also help. Designate use of local-option sales tax revenue solely to local school boards, for construction and updating, by skipping all the “pet projects.” Using LOST funds would have everyone’s skin in the game, not just property owners. 
   
Until the senior issues mentioned above are addressed, bonds will continue to receive our “no” vote.
